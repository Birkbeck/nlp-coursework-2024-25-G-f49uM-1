       "'nd travelled to\\nand fro across the paper.\\n\\n... but it seems that the Fair Lady has a Brother, who, finding Me\\nEnamoured, threw down the Gauntlet. I soundly whipt the presumptuous\\nChild, and so the Affair ends. Now, as you, My dear Frank, also took\\nsome Interest in the Lady, I write for the Express Purpose of informing\\nYou that at my Hands she has received no Hurt, nor is not like to. This\\nI in part tell You that You shall not imagine Yr self in Honor bound\\nagain to call Me out, which Purpose, an I mistake not, I yesterday read\\nin Yr Eyes. I should be Exceeding loth to meet You in a Second Time,\\nwhen I should consider it my Duty to teach You an even severer Lesson\\nthan Before. This I am not Wishful of doing for the Liking I bear You.\\n\\n\"So in all Friendship believe me, Frank,\\n\\n\"Your most Obedient, Humble\\n\\n\"DEVIL.\"\\n\\nHis Grace of Andover paused, pen held in mid-air. A mocking smile dawned\\nin his eyes, and he wrote again.\\n\\n\"In the event of any Desire on Yr Part to hazard Yr Luck with my late\\nParamour, Permit Me to warn You \\'gainst the Bantam Brother, who is in\\nVery Truth a Fire-Eater, and would wish to make of You, as of Me, one\\nMouthfull. I shall hope to see You at the Queensberry Rout on Thursday,\\nwhen You may Once More strive to direct mine Erring Footsteps on to the\\nThorny Path of Virtue.\"\\n\\nHis Grace read the postscript through with another satisfied, sardonic\\nsmile. Then he folded the letter, and affixing a wafer, peremptorily\\nstruck the hand-bell at his side.\\n\\nAnd the Honourable Frank Fortescue, reading the postscript half-an-hour\\nlater, smiled too, but differently. Also he sighed and put the letter\\ninto the fire.\\n\\n\"And so ends another _affaire_. ... I wonder if you\\'ll go insolently to\\nthe very end?\" he said softly, watching the paper shrivel and flare up.\\n\"I would to God you might fall honestly in love--and that the lady might\\nsave you from yourself--my poor Devil!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nAT THE CHEQUERS INN, FALLOWFIELD\\n\\n\\nChadber was the name of the host, florid of countenance, portly of\\nperson, and of manner pompous and urbane. Solely within the walls of the\\nChequers lay his world, that inn having been acquired by his\\ngreat-grandfather as far back as the year 1667, when the jovial Stuart\\nKing sat on the English throne, and the Hanoverian Electors were not yet\\ndreamed of.\\n\\nA Tory was Mr. Chadber to the backbone. None so bitter \\'gainst the\\nlittle German as he, and surely none had looked forward more eagerly to\\nthe advent of the gallant Charles Edward. If he confined his patriotism\\nto drinking success to Prince Charlie\\'s campaign, who shall blame him?\\nAnd if, when sundry Whig gentlemen halted at the Chequers on their way\\nto the coast, and, calling for a bottle of Rhenish, bade him toss down a\\nglass himself with a health to his Majesty, again who shall blame Mr.\\nChadber for obeying? What was a health one way or another when you had\\nrendered active service to two of his Stuart Highness\\'s adherents?\\n\\nIt was Mr. Chadber\\'s boast, uttered only to his admiring Tory\\nneighbours, that he had, at the risk of his own life, given shelter to\\ntwo fugitives of the disastrous \\'Forty-five, who had come so far out of\\ntheir way as quiet Fallowfield. That no one had set eyes on either of\\nthe men was no reason for doubting an honest landlord\\'s word. But no one\\nwould have thought of doubting any statement that Mr. Chadber might\\nmake. Mine host of the Chequers was a great personage in the town, being\\nable both to read and to write, and having once, when young, travelled\\nas far north as London town, staying there for ten days and setting\\neyes on no less a person than the great Duke of Marlborough himself when\\nthat gentleman was riding along the Strand on his way to St. James\\'s.\\n\\nAlso, it was a not-to-be-ignored fact that Mr. Chadber\\'s home-brewed ale\\nwas far superior to that sold by the landlord of the rival inn at the\\nother end of the village.\\n\\nAltogether he was a most important character, and no one was more aware\\nof his importance than his worthy self.\\n\\nTo \"gentlemen born,\" whom, he protested, he could distinguish at a\\nglance, he was almost obsequiously polite, but on clerks and underlings,\\nand men who bore no signs of affluence about their persons, he wasted\\nnone of his deference.\\n\\nThus it was that, when a little green-clad lawyer alighted one day from\\nthe mail coach and entered the coffee-room at the Chequers, he was\\nreceived with pomposity and scarce-veiled condescension.\\n\\nHe was nervous, it seemed, and more than a little worried. He offended\\nMr. Chadber at the outset, when he insinuated that he was come to meet a\\ngentleman who might perhaps be rather shabbily clothed, rather short of\\npurse, and even of rather unsavoury repute. Very severely did Mr.\\nChadber give him to understand that guests of that description were\\nentirely unknown at the Chequers.\\n\\nThere was an air of mystery about the lawyer, and it appeared almost as\\nthough he were striving to probe mine host. Mr. Chadber bridled, a\\nlittle, and became aloof and haughty.\\n\\nWhen the lawyer dared openly to ask if he had had any dealings with\\nhighwaymen of late, he was properly and thoroughly affronted.\\n\\nThe lawyer became suddenly more at ease. He eyed Mr. Chadber\\nspeculatively, holding a pinch of snuff to one thin nostril.\\n\\n\"Perhaps you have staying here a certain--ah--Sir--Anthony--Ferndale?\"\\nhe hazarded.\\n\\nThe gentle air of injury fell from Mr. Chadber. Certainly he had, and\\ncome only yesterday a-purpose to meet his solicitor.\\n\\nThe lawyer nodded.\\n\\n\"I am he. Be so good as to apprise Sir Anthony of my arrival.\"\\n\\nMr. Chadber bowed exceeding low, and implored the lawyer not to remain\\nin the draughty coffee-room. Sir Anthony would never forgive him an he\\nallowed his solicitor to await him there. Would he not come to Sir\\nAnthony\\'s private parlour?\\n\\nThe very faintest of smiles creased the lawyer\\'s thin face as he walked\\nalong the passage in Mr. Chadber\\'s wake.\\n\\nHe was ushered into a low-ceilinged, pleasant chamber looking out on to\\nthe quiet street, and left alone what time Mr. Chadber went in search of\\nSir Anthony.\\n\\nThe room was panelled and ceilinged in oak, with blue curtains to the\\nwindows and blue cushions on the high-backed settle by the fire. A table\\nstood in the centre of the floor, with a white table-cloth thereon and\\nplaces laid for two. Another smaller table stood by the fireplace,\\ntogether with a chair and a stool.\\n\\nThe lawyer took silent stock of his surroundings, and reflected grimly\\non the landlord\\'s sudden change of front. It would appear that Sir\\nAnthony was a gentleman of some standing at the Chequers.\\n\\nYet the little man was plainly unhappy, and fell to pacing to and fro,\\nhis chin sunk low on his breast, and his hands clasped behind his back.\\nHe was come to seek the disgraced son of an Earl, and he was afraid of\\nwhat he might find.\\n\\nSix years ago Lord John Carstares, eldest son of the Earl of Wyncham,\\nhad gone with his brother, the Hon. Richard, to a card party, and had\\nreturned a dishonoured man.\\n\\nThat Jack Carstares should cheat was incredible, ridiculous, and at\\nfirst no one had believed the tale that so quickly spread. But he had\\nconfirmed that tale himself, defiantly and without shame, before riding\\noff, bound, men said, for France and the foreign parts. Brother Richard\\nwas left, so said the countryside, to marry the lady they were both in\\nlove with. Nothing further had been heard of Lord John, and the outraged\\nEarl forbade his name to be mentioned at Wyncham, swearing to disinherit\\nthe prodigal. Richard espoused the fair Lady Lavinia and brought her to\\nlive at the great house, strangely forlorn now without Lord John\\'s\\nmagnetic presence; but, far from being an elated bridegroom, he seemed\\nto have brought gloom with him from the honeymoon, so silent and so\\nunhappy was he.\\n\\nSix years drifted slowly by without bringing any news of Lord John, and\\nthen, two months ago, journeying from London to Wyncham, Richard\\'s coach\\nhad been waylaid, and by a highwayman who proved to be none other than\\nthe scapegrace peer.\\n\\nRichard\\'s feelings may be imagined. Lord John had been singularly\\nunimpressed by anything beyond the humour of the situation. That,\\nhowever, had struck him most forcibly, and he had burst out into a fit\\nof laughter that had brought a lump into Richard\\'s throat, and a fresh\\nache into his heart.\\n\\nUpon pressure John had given his brother the address of the inn, \"in\\ncase of accidents,\" and told him to ask for \"Sir Anthony Ferndale\" if\\never he should need him. Then with one hearty handshake, he had galloped\\noff into the darkness....\\n\\nThe lawyer stopped his restless pacing to listen. Down the passage was\\ncoming the tap-tap of high heels on the wooden floor, accompanied by a\\nslight rustle as of stiff silks.\\n\\nThe little man tugged suddenly at his cravat. Supposing--supposing\\ndebonair Lord John was no longer debonair? Supposing--he dared not\\nsuppose anything. Nervously he drew a roll of parchment from his pocket\\nand stood fingering it.\\n\\nA firm hand was laid on the door-handle, turning it cleanly round. The\\ndoor opened to admit a veritable apparition, and was closed again with a\\nsnap.\\n\\nThe lawyer found himself gazing at a slight, rather tall gentleman who\\nswept him a profound bow, gracefully flourishing his smart\\nthree-cornered hat with one hand and delicately clasping cane and\\nperfumed handkerchief with the other. He was dressed in the height of\\nthe Versailles fashion, with full-skirted coat of palest lilac laced\\nwith silver, small-clothes and stockings of white, and waistcoat of\\nflowered satin. On his feet he wore shoes with high red heels and silver\\nbuckles, while a wig of the latest mode, marvellously powdered and\\ncurled and smacking greatly of Paris, adorned his shapely head. In the\\nfoaming lace of his cravat reposed a diamond pin, and on the slim hand,\\nhalf covered by drooping laces, glowed and flashed a huge emerald.\\n\\nThe lawyer stared and stared again, and it was not until a pair of deep\\nblue, rather wistful eyes met his in a quizzical glance, that he found\\nhis tongue. Then a look of astonishment came into his face, and he took\\na half step forward.\\n\\n\"Master Jack!\" he gasped. \"Master--_Jack_!\"\\n\\nThe elegant gentleman came forward and held up a reproving hand. The\\npatch at the corner of his mouth quivered, and the blue eyes danced.\\n\\n\"I perceive that you are not acquainted with me, Mr. Warburton,\" he\\nsaid, amusement in his pleasant, slightly drawling voice. \"Allow me to\\npresent myself: Sir Anthony Ferndale, _a vous servir_!\"\\n\\nA gleam of humour appeared in the lawyer\\'s own eyes as he clasped the\\noutstretched hand.\\n\\n\"I think you are perhaps not acquainted with yourself, my lord,\" he\\nremarked drily.\\n\\nLord John laid his hat and cane on the small table, and looked faintly\\nintrigued.\\n\\n\"What\\'s your meaning, Mr. Warburton?\"\\n\\n\"I am come, my lord, to inform you that the Earl, your father, died a\\nmonth since.\"\\n\\nThe blue eyes widened, grew of a sudden hard, and narrowed again.\\n\\n\"Is that really so? Well, well! Apoplexy, I make no doubt?\"\\n\\nThe lawyer\\'s lips twitched uncontrollably.\\n\\n\"No, Master Jack; my lord died of heart failure.\"\\n\\n\"Say you so? Dear me! But will you not be seated, sir? In a moment my\\nservant will have induced the _chef_ to serve dinner. You will honour\\nme, I trust?\"\\n\\nThe lawyer murmured his thanks and sat down on the settle, watching the\\nother with puzzled eyes.\\n\\nThe Earl drew up a chair for himself and stretched his foot to the fire.\\n\\n\"Six years, eh? I protest \\'tis prodigious good to see your face again,\\nMr. Warburton.... And I\\'m the Earl? Earl and High Toby, by Gad!\" He\\nlaughed softly.\\n\\n\"I have here the documents, my lord....\"\\n\\nCarstares eyed the roll through his quizzing glass.\\n\\n\"I perceive them. Pray return them to your pocket, Mr. Warburton.\"\\n\\n\"But there are certain legal formalities, my lord--\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. Pray do not let us mention them!\"\\n\\n\"But, sir!\"\\n\\nThen the Earl smiled, and his smile was singularly sweet and winning.\\n\\n\"At least, not until after dinner, Warburton! Instead, you shall tell me\\nhow you found me?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Richard directed me where to come, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, of course! I had forgot that I told him my--_pied-à-terre_ when I\\nwaylaid him.\"\\n\\nThe lawyer nearly shuddered at this cheerful, barefaced mention of his\\nlordship\\'s disreputable profession.\\n\\n\"Er--indeed, sir. Mr. Richard is eager for you to return.\"\\n\\nThe handsome young face clouded over. My lord shook his head.\\n\\n\"Impossible, my dear Warburton. I am convinced Dick never voiced so\\nfoolish a suggestion. Come now, confess! \\'tis your own fabrication?\"\\n\\nWarburton ignored the bantering tone and spoke very deliberately.\\n\\n\"At all events, my lord, I believe him anxious to make--amends.\"\\n\\nCarstares shot an alert, suspicious glance at him.\\n\\n\"Ah!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. Amends.\"\\n\\nMy lord studied his emerald with half-closed eyelids.\\n\\n\"But why--amends, Warburton?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Is not that the word, sir?\"\\n\\n\"I confess it strikes me as inapt. Doubtless I am dull of\\ncomprehension.\"\\n\\n\"You were not wont to be, my lord.\"\\n\\n\"No? But six years changes a man, Warburton. Pray, is Mr. Carstares\\nwell?\"\\n\\n\"I believe so, sir,\" replied the lawyer, frowning at the deft change of\\nsubject.\\n\\n\"And Lady Lavinia?\"\\n\\n\"Ay.\" Mr. Warburton looked searchingly across at him, seeing which, my\\nlord\\'s eyes danced afresh, brim full with mischief.\\n\\n\"I am delighted to hear it. Pray present my compliments to Mr. Carstares\\nand beg him to use Wyncham as he wills.\"\\n\\n\"Sir! Master Jack! I implore you!\" burst from the lawyer, and he sprang\\nup, moving excitedly away, his hands twitching, his face haggard.\\n\\nMy lord stiffened in his chair. He watched the other\\'s jerky movements\\nanxiously, but his voice when he spoke was even and cold.\\n\\n\"Well, sir?\"\\n\\nMr. Warburton wheeled and came back to the fireplace, looking hungrily\\ndown at my lord\\'s impassive countenance. With an effort he seemed to\\ncontrol himself.\\n\\n\"Master Jack, I had better tell you what you have already guessed. I\\nknow.\"\\n\\nUp went one haughty eyebrow.\\n\\n\"You know what, Mr. Warburton?\"\\n\\n\"That you are innocent!\"\\n\\n\"Of what, Mr. Warburton?\"\\n\\n\"Of cheating at cards, sir!\"\\n\\nMy lord relaxed, and flicked a speck of dust from his great cuff.\\n\\n\"I regret the necessity of having to disillusion you, Mr. Warburton.\"\\n\\n\"My lord, do not fence with me, I beg! You can trust me, surely?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Then do not keep up this pretence with me; no, nor look so hard\\nneither! I\\'ve watched you grow up right from the cradle, and Master Dick\\ntoo, and I know you both through and through. I _know_ you never cheated\\nat Colonel Dare\\'s nor anywhere else! I could have sworn it at the\\ntime--ay, when I saw Master Dick\\'s face, I knew at once that he it was\\nwho had played foul, and you had but taken the blame!\"\\n\\n\"No!\"\\n\\n\"I know better! Can you, Master Jack, look me in the face and truthfully\\ndeny what I have said? Can you? Can you?\" My lord sat silent.\\n\\nWith a sigh, Warburton sank on to the settle once more. He was flushed,\\nand his eyes shone, but he spoke calmly again.\\n\\n\"Of course you cannot. I have never known you lie. You need not fear I\\nshall betray you. I kept silence all these years for my lord\\'s sake, and\\nI will not speak now until you give me leave.\"\\n\\n\"Which I never shall.\"\\n\\n\"Master Jack, think better of it, I beg of you! Now that my lord is\\ndead--\"\\n\\n\"It makes no difference.\"\\n\\n\"No difference? \\'Twas not for his sake? \\'Twas not because you knew how\\nhe loved Master Dick?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Then \\'tis Lady Lavinia--\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"But--\"\\n\\nMy lord smiled sadly.\\n\\n\"Ah, Warburton! And you averred you knew us through and through! For\\nwhose sake should it be but his own?\"\\n\\n\"I feared it!\" The lawyer made a hopeless gesture with his hands. \"You\\nwill not come back?\"\\n\\n\"No, Warburton, I will not; Dick may manage my estates. I remain on the\\nroad.\"\\n\\nWarburton made one last effort.\\n\\n\"My lord!\" he cried despairingly, \"Will you not at least think of the\\ndisgrace to the name an you be caught?\"\\n\\nThe shadows vanished from my lord\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"Mr. Warburton, I protest you are of a morbid turn of mind! Do you know,\\nI had not thought of so unpleasant a contingency? I swear I was not born\\nto be hanged!\"\\n\\nThe lawyer would have said more, had not the entrance of a servant,\\ncarrying a loaded tray, put an end to all private conversation. The man\\nplaced dishes upon the table, lighted candles, and arranged two chairs.\\n\\n\"Dinner is served, sir,\" he said.\\n\\nMy lord nodded, and made a slight gesture toward the windows. Instantly\\nthe man went over to them and drew the heavy curtains across.\\n\\nMy lord turned to Mr. Warburton.\\n\\n\"What say you, sir? Shall it be burgundy or claret, or do you prefer\\nsack?\"\\n\\nWarburton decided in favour of claret.\\n\\n\"Claret, Jim,\" ordered Carstares, and rose to his feet.\\n\\n\"I trust the drive has whetted your appetite, Warburton, for honest\\nChadber will be monstrous hurt an you do not justice to his capons.\"\\n\\n\"I shall endeavour to spare his feelings,\" replied the lawyer with a\\ntwinkle, and seated himself at the table.\\n\\nWhatever might be Mr. Chadber\\'s failings, he possessed an excellent\\ncook. Mr. Warburton dined very well, beginning on a fat duck, and\\ncontinuing through the many courses that constituted the meal.\\n\\nWhen the table was cleared, the servant gone, and the port before them,\\nhe endeavoured to guide the conversation back into the previous\\nchannels. But he reckoned without my lord, and presently found himself\\ndiscussing the Pretender\\'s late rebellion. He sat up suddenly.\\n\\n\"There were rumours that you were with the Prince, sir.\"\\n\\nCarstares set down his glass in genuine amazement.\\n\\n\"I?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, yes. I do not know whence the rumour came, but it reached\\nWyncham. My lord said nought, but I think Mr. Richard hardly credited\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"I should hope not! Why should they think me turned rebel, pray?\"\\n\\nMr. Warburton frowned.\\n\\n\"Rebel, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Rebel, Mr. Warburton. I have served under his Majesty.\"\\n\\n\"The Carstares were ever Tories, Master Jack, true to their rightful\\nking.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Warburton, I owe nought to the Stuart princes. I was born in\\nKing George the First\\'s reign, and I protest I am a good Whig.\"\\n\\nWarburton shook his head disapprovingly.\\n\\n\"There has never been a Whig in the Wyncham family, sir.\"\\n\\n\"And you hope there never will be again, eh? What of Dick? Is he\\nfaithful to the Pretender?\"\\n\\n\"I think Mr. Richard does not interest himself in politics, sir.\"\\n\\nCarstares raised his eyebrows, and there fell a silence.\\n\\nAfter a minute or two Mr. Warburton cleared his throat.\\n\\n\"I--I suppose, sir--you have no idea of--er--discontinuing\\nyour--er--profession?\"\\n\\nMy lord gave an irrepressible little laugh.\\n\\n\"Faith, Mr. Warburton, I\\'ve only just begun!\"\\n\\n\"Only--But a year ago, Mr. Richard--\"\\n\\n\"I held him up? Ay, but to tell the truth, sir, I\\'ve not done much since\\nthen!\"\\n\\n\"Then, sir, you are not--er--notorious?\"\\n\\n\"Good gad, no! Notorious, forsooth! Confess, Warburton, you thought me\\nsome heroic figure? \\'Gentleman Harry\\', perhaps?\"\\n\\nWarburton blushed.\\n\\n\"Well, sir--I--er--wondered.\"\\n\\n\"I shall have to disappoint you, I perceive. I doubt Bow Street has\\nnever heard of me--and--to tell the truth--\\'tis not an occupation which\\nappeals vastly to my senses.\"\\n\\n\"Then why, my lord, do you continue?\"\\n\\n\"I must have some excuse for roaming the country,\" pleaded Jack. \"I\\ncould not be idle.\"\\n\\n\"You are not--compelled to--er--rob, my lord?\"\\n\\nCarstares wrinkled his brow inquiringly.\\n\\n\"Compelled? Ah--I take your meaning. No, Warburton, I have enough for my\\nwants--now; time was--but that is past. I rob for amusement\\'s sake.\"\\n\\nWarburton looked steadily across at him.\\n\\n\"I am surprised, my lord, that you, a Carstares, should find\\nit--amusing.\"\\n\\nJohn was silent for a moment, and when he at length spoke it was\\ndefiantly and with a bitterness most unusual in him.\\n\\n\"The world, Mr. Warburton, has not treated me so kindly that I should\\nfeel any qualms of conscience. But, an it gives you any satisfaction to\\nknow it, I will tell you that my robberies are few and far between. You\\nspoke a little while ago of my probable--ah--fate--on Tyburn Tree. I\\nthink you need not fear to hear of that.\"\\n\\n\"I--It gives me great satisfaction, my lord, I confess,\" stammered the\\nlawyer, and found nothing more to say. After a long pause he again\\nproduced the bulky roll of parchment and laid it down before the Earl\\nwith the apologetic murmur of:\\n\\n\"Business, my lord!\"\\n\\nCarstares descended from the clouds and eyed the packet with evident\\ndistaste. He proceeded to fill his and his companion\\'s glass very\\nleisurely. That done, he heaved a lugubrious sigh, caught Mr.\\nWarburton\\'s eye, laughed in answer to its quizzical gleam, and broke the\\nseal.\\n\\n\"Since you _will_ have it, sir--business!\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nMr. Warburton stayed the night at the Chequers and travelled back to\\nWyncham next day by the two o\\'clock coach. He played piquet and ecarte\\nwith my lord all the evening, and then retired to bed, not having found\\nan opportunity to argue his mission as he had hoped to do. Whenever he\\nhad tried to turn the conversation that way he had been gently but\\nfirmly led into safer channels, and somehow had found it impossible to\\nget back. My lord was the gayest and most charming of companions, but\\ntalk \"business\" he would not. He regaled the lawyer with spicy anecdotes\\nand tales of abroad, but never once allowed Mr. Warburton to speak of\\nhis home or of his brother.\\n\\nThe lawyer retired to rest in a measure reassured by the other\\'s good\\nspirits, but at the same time dispirited by his failure to induce\\nCarstares to return to Wyncham.\\n\\nNext morning, although he was not up until twelve, he was before my\\nlord, who only appeared in time for lunch, which was served as before in\\nthe oak parlour.\\n\\nHe entered the room in his usual leisurely yet decided fashion and made\\nMr. Warburton a marvellous leg. Then he bore him off to inspect his\\nmare, Jenny, of whom he was inordinately proud. By the time they\\nreturned to the parlour luncheon was served, and Mr. Warburton realised\\nthat he had scarcely any time left in which to plead his cause.\\n\\nMy lord\\'s servant hovered continually about the room, waiting on them,\\nuntil his master bade him go to attend to the lawyer\\'s valise. When the\\ndoor had closed on his retreating form, Carstares leaned back in his\\nchair, and, with a rather dreary little smile, turned to his companion.\\n\\n\"You want to reason with me, I know, Mr. Warburton, and, indeed, I will\\nlisten an I must. But I would so much rather that you left the subject\\nalone, believe me.\"\\n\\nWarburton sensed the finality in his voice, and wisely threw away his\\nlast chance.\\n\\n\"I understand \\'tis painful, my lord, and I will say no more. Only\\nremember--and think on it, I beg!\"\\n\\nThe concern in his face touched my lord.\\n\\n\"You are too good to me, Mr. Warburton, I vow. I can only say that I\\nappreciate your kindness--and your forbearance. And I trust that you\\nwill forgive my seeming churlishness and believe that I am indeed\\ngrateful to you.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I might do more for you, Master Jack!\" stammered Warburton, made\\nmiserable by the wistful note in his favourite\\'s voice. There was no\\ntime for more; the coach already awaited him, and his valise had been\\nhoisted up. As they stood together in the porch, he could only grip my\\nlord\\'s hand tightly and say good-bye. Then he got hurriedly into the\\ncoach, and the door was slammed behind him.\\n\\nMy lord made his leg, and watched the heavy vehicle move forward and\\nroll away down the street. Then with a stifled sigh he turned and walked\\ntowards the stables. His servant saw him coming and went at once to meet\\nhim.\\n\\n\"The mare, sir?\"\\n\\n\"As you say, Jim--the mare. In an hour.\"\\n\\nHe turned and would have strolled back.\\n\\n\"Sir--your honour!\"\\n\\nHe paused, looking over his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re on the look-out, sir. Best be careful.\"\\n\\n\"They always are, Jim. But thanks.\"\\n\\n\"Ye--ye wouldn\\'t take me with ye, sir?\" pleadingly.\\n\\n\"Take you? Faith, no! I\\'ve no mind to lead you into danger. And you\\nserve me best by remaining to carry out my orders.\"\\n\\nThe man fell back.\\n\\n\"Ay, sir; but--but--\"\\n\\n\"There are none, Jim.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir--but ye _will_ have a care?\"\\n\\n\"I will be the most cautious of men.\" He walked away on the word, and\\npassed into the house.\\n\\nIn an hour he was a very different being. Gone was the emerald ring, the\\nfoppish cane; the languid air, too, had disappeared, leaving him brisk\\nand businesslike. He was dressed for riding, with buff coat and buckskin\\nbreeches, and shining top boots. A sober brown wig replaced the powdered\\ncreation, and a black tricorne was set rakishly atop.\\n\\nHe stood in the deserted porch, watching Jim strap his baggage to the\\nsaddle, occasionally giving a curt direction. Presently Mr. Chadber\\nappeared with the stirrup-cup, which he drained and handed back with a\\nword of thanks and a guinea at the bottom.\\n\\nSomeone called lustily from within, and the landlord, bowing very low,\\nmurmured apologies and vanished.\\n\\nJim cast a last glance at the saddle-girths, and, leaving the mare\\nquietly standing in the road, came up to his master with gloves and\\nwhip.\\n\\nCarstares took them silently and fell to tapping his boot, his eyes\\nthoughtfully on the man\\'s face.\\n\\n\"You will hire a coach, as usual,\" he said at length, \"and take my\\nbaggage to--\" (He paused, frowning)--\"Lewes. You will engage a room at\\nthe White Hart and order dinner. I shall wear--apricot and--h\\'m!\"\\n\\n\"Blue, sir?\" ventured Jim, with an idea of being helpful.\\n\\nHis master\\'s eyes crinkled at the corners.\\n\\n\"You are a humorist, Salter. Apricot and cream. Cream? Yes, \\'tis a\\npleasing thought--cream. That is all--Jenny!\"\\n\\nThe mare turned her head, whinnying as he came towards her.\\n\\n\"Good lass!\" He mounted lightly and patted her glossy neck. Then he\\nleaned sideways in the saddle to speak again to Salter, who stood beside\\nhim, one hand on the bridle.\\n\\n\"The cloak?\"\\n\\n\"Behind you, sir.\"\\n\\n\"My wig?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Pistols?\"\\n\\n\"Ready primed, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Good. I shall be in Lewes in time for dinner--with luck.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. Ye--ye will have a care?\" anxiously.\\n\\n\"Have I not told you?\" He straightened in the saddle, touched the mare\\nwith his heel, and bestowing a quick smile and a nod on his man, trotted\\neasily away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nMY LORD AT THE WHITE HART\\n\\n\\n\"Sir Anthony Ferndale\" sat before the dressing-table in his room at the\\nWhite Hart, idly polishing his nails. A gorgeous silk dressing gown lay\\nover the back of his chair, and, behind him, Jim was attending to his\\nwig, at the same time hovering anxiously over the coat and waistcoat\\nthat were waiting to be donned.\\n\\nCarstares left off polishing his nails, yawned, and leaned back in his\\nchair, a slim, graceful figure in cambric shirt and apricot satin\\nbreeches. He studied his cravat for some moments in the mirror, and\\nlifted a hand to it. Salter held his breath. With extreme deliberation\\nthe hand moved a diamond and emerald pin the fraction of an inch to one\\nside, and fell to his side again. Salter drew a relieved breath, which\\nbrought his master\\'s eyes round to himself.\\n\\n\"No trouble, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"None at all, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Neither had I. \\'Twas most surprisingly easy. The birds had no more\\nfight in them than sparrows. Two men in a coach--one a bullying rascal\\nof a merchant, the other his clerk. Gad! but I was sorry for that little\\nman!\" He paused, his hand on the rouge pot.\\n\\nSalter looked an inquiry.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" nodded Carstares. \"Very sorry. The fat man would appear to bully\\nand browbeat him after the manner of his kind; he even blamed him for my\\nadvent, the greasy coward! Yes, Jim, you are right--he did not appeal to\\nme, _ce M. Fudby_. So--\" ingenuously, \"I relieved him of his cash-box\\nand two hundred guineas. A present for the poor of Lewes.\"\\n\\nJim jerked his shoulder, frowning.\\n\\n\"If ye give away all ye get, sir, why do ye rob at all?\" he asked\\nbluntly.\\n\\nHis whimsical little smile played about my lord\\'s mouth.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis an object for my life, Jim: a noble object. And I believe it\\namuses me to play Robin Hood--take from the rich to give to the poor,\"\\nhe added, for Salter\\'s benefit. \"But to return to my victims--you would\\nhave laughed had you but seen my little man come tumbling out of the\\ncoach when I opened the door!\"\\n\\n\"Tumble, sir? Why should he do that?\"\\n\\n\"He was at pains to explain the reason. It seems he had been commanded\\nto hold the door to prevent my entering--so when I jerked it open,\\nsooner than loose his hold, he fell out on to the road. Of course, I\\napologised most abjectly--and we had some conversation. Quite a nice\\nlittle man.... It made me laugh to see him sprawling on the road,\\nthough!\"\\n\\n\"Wish I could have seen it, your honour. I would ha\\' liked fine to ha\\'\\nbeen beside ye.\" He looked down at the lithe form with some pride. \"I\\'d\\ngive something to see ye hold up a coach, sir!\"\\n\\nHaresfoot in hand, Jack met his admiring eyes in the glass, and laughed.\\n\\n\"I make no doubt you would.... I have cultivated a superb voice, a\\ntrifle thick and beery, a little loud, perhaps--ah, something to dream\\nof o\\' nights! I doubt they do, too,\" he added reflectively, and affixed\\nthe patch at the corner of his mouth.\\n\\n\"So? A little low, you think? But \\'twill suffice--What\\'s toward?\"\\n\\nDown below in the street there was a great stirring and bustling:\\nhorses\\' hoofs, shouts from the ostlers, and the sound of wheels on the\\ncobble-stones. Jim went to the window and looked down, craning his neck\\nto see over the balcony.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a coach arrived, sir.\"\\n\\n\"That much had I gathered,\" replied my lord, busy with the powder.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. O lord, sir!\" He was shaken with laughter.\\n\\n\"What now?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the curiousest sight, sir! Two gentlemen, one fat and t\\'other\\nsmall! One\\'s all shrivelled-looking, like a spider, while t\\'other--\"\\n\\n\"Resembles a hippopotamus--particularly in the face?\"\\n\\n\"Well yes, sir. He do rather. And he be wearing purple.\"\\n\\n\"Heavens, yes! Purple, and an orange waistcoat!\"\\n\\nJim peered afresh.\\n\\n\"So it is, sir! But how did you know?\" Even as he put the question,\\nunderstanding flashed into Jim\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"I rather think that I have had the honour of meeting these gentlemen,\"\\nreplied my lord placidly. \"My buckle, Jim.... Is\\'t a prodigious great\\ncoach with wheels picked out in yellow?\"\\n\\n\"Ay, your honour. The gentlemen seem a bit put out, too.\"\\n\\n\"That is quite probable. Does the smaller gentleman wear\\nsomewhat--ah--muddied garments?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t see, sir; he stands behind the fat gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bumble Bee.... Jim!\"\\n\\n\"Sir!\" Jim turned quickly at the sound of the sharp voice.\\n\\nHe found that my lord had risen, and was holding up a waistcoat of\\npea-green pattern on a bilious yellow ground, between a disgusted finger\\nand thumb. Before his severe frown Jim dropped his eyes and stood\\nlooking for all the world like a schoolboy detected in some crime.\\n\\n\"You put this--this monstrosity--out for _me_ to wear?\" in awful tones.\\n\\nJim eyed the waistcoat gloomily and nodded.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Did I not specify cream ground?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. I thought--I thought that \\'twas cream!\"\\n\\n\"My good friend, it is--it is--I cannot say what it is. And pea-green!\"\\nhe shuddered. \"Remove it.\"\\n\\nJim hurried forward and disposed of the offending garment.\\n\\n\"And bring me the broidered satin. Yes, that is it. It is particularly\\npleasing to the eye.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" agreed the abashed Jim.\\n\\n\"You are excused this time,\" added my lord, with a twinkle in his eye.\\n\"What are our two friends doing?\"\\n\\nSalter went back to the window\\n\\n\"They\\'ve gone into the house, sir. No, here\\'s the spider gentleman! He\\ndo seem in a hurry, your honour!\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" murmured his lordship. \"You may assist me into this coat. Thanks.\"\\n\\nWith no little difficulty, my lord managed to enter into the fine satin\\ngarment, which, when on, seemed moulded to his back, so excellently did\\nit fit. He shook out his ruffles and slipped the emerald ring on to his\\nfinger with a slight frown.\\n\\n\"I believe I shall remain here some few days,\" he remarked presently.\\n\"To--ah--allay suspicion.\" He looked across at his man as he spoke,\\nthrough his lashes.\\n\\nIt was not in Jim\\'s nature to inquire into his master\\'s affairs, much\\nless to be surprised at anything he might do or say. He was content to\\nreceive and promptly execute his orders, and to worship Carstares with a\\ndog-like devotion, following blindly in his wake, happy as long as he\\nmight serve him.\\n\\nCarstares had found him in France, very down upon his luck, having been\\ndischarged from the service of his late master owing to the penniless\\ncondition of that gentleman\\'s pocket. He had engaged him as his own\\npersonal servant, and the man had remained with him ever since, proving\\nan invaluable acquisition to my Lord John. Despite a singularly wooden\\ncountenance, he was by no means a fool, and he had helped Carstares out\\nof more than one tight corner during his inglorious and foolhardy career\\nas highwayman. He probably understood his somewhat erratic master better\\nthan anyone else, and he now divined what was in his mind. He returned\\nthat glance with a significant wink.\\n\\n\"\\'Twas them gentlemen ye held up to-day, sir?\" he asked, jerking an\\nexpressive thumb towards the window.\\n\\n\"M\\'m. Mr. Bumble Bee and friend. It would almost appear so. I think I do\\nnot fully appreciate Mr. Bumble Bee. I find his conduct rather tiresome.\\nBut it is just possible that he thinks the same of me. I will further my\\nacquaintance with him.\"\\n\\nJim grunted scornfully, and an inquiring eye was cocked at him.\\n\\n\"You do not admire our friend? Pray, do not judge him by his exterior.\\nHe may possess a beautiful mind. But I do not think so. N-no, I really\\ndo not think so.\" He chuckled a little. \"Do you know, Jim, I believe I\\nam going to enjoy myself to-night!\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t doubt it, your honour. \\'Twere child\\'s play to trick the fat\\ngentleman.\"\\n\\n\"Probably. But it is not with the fat gentleman that I shall have to\\ndeal. \\'Tis with all the officials of this charming town, an I mistake\\nnot. Do I hear the small spider returning?\"\\n\\nSalter stepped back to the window.\\n\\n\"Ay, sir--with three others.\"\\n\\n\"Pre-cisely. Be so good as to hand me my snuff-box. And my cane. Thank\\nyou. I feel the time has now come for me to put in an appearance. Pray,\\nbear in mind that I am new come from France and journey by easy stages\\nto London. And cultivate a stupid expression. Yes, that will do\\nexcellently.\"\\n\\nJim grinned delightedly; he had assumed no expression of stupidity, and\\nwas consequently much pleased with this pleasantry. He swung open the\\ndoor with an air, and watched \"Sir Anthony\" mince along the passage to\\nthe stairs.\\n\\nIn the coffee-room the city merchant, Mr. Fudby by name, was relating\\nthe story of his wrongs, with many an impressive pause, and much\\nemphasis, to the mayor, town-clerk, and beadle of Lewes. All three had\\nbeen fetched by Mr. Chilter, his clerk, in obedience to his orders, for\\nthe bigger the audience the better pleased was Mr. Fudby. He was now\\nenjoying himself quite considerably, despite the loss of his precious\\ncash-box.\\n\\nSo was not Mr. Hedges, the mayor. He was a fussy little man who suffered\\nfrom dyspepsia; he was not interested in the affair, and he did not see\\nwhat was to be done for Mr. Fudby. Further, he had been haled from his\\ndinner, and he was hungry; and, above all, he found Mr. Fudby very\\nunattractive. Still, a highroad robbery was serious matter enough, and\\nsome course of action must be thought out; so he listened to the story\\nwith an assumption of interest, looking exceedingly wise, and, at the\\nproper moments, uttering sounds betokening concern.\\n\\nThe more he saw and heard of Mr. Fudby, the less he liked him. Neither\\ndid the town-clerk care for him. There was that about Mr. Fudby that did\\nnot endear him to his fellow-men, especially when they chanced to be his\\ninferiors in the social scale. The beadle did not think much about\\nanything. Having decided (and rightly) that the affair had nothing\\nwhatever to do with him, he leaned back in his chair and stared stolidly\\nup at the ceiling.\\n\\nThe tale Mr. Fudby was telling bore surprisingly little resemblance to\\nthe truth. It was a much embellished version, in which he himself had\\nbehaved with quite remarkable gallantry. It had been gradually concocted\\nduring the journey to Lewes.\\n\\nHe was still holding forth when my lord entered the room. Carstares\\nraised his glass languidly to survey the assembled company, bowed\\nslightly, and walked over to the fire. He seated himself in an armchair\\nand took no further notice of anybody.\\n\\nMr. Hedges had recognised at a glance that here was some _grand\\nseigneur_ and wished that Mr. Fudby would not speak in so loud a voice.\\nBut that individual, delighted at having a new auditor, continued his\\ntale with much relish and in a still louder tone.\\n\\nMy lord yawned delicately and took a pinch of snuff.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" fussed Mr. Hedges. \"But, short of sending to London for the\\nRunners, I do not see what I can do. If I send to London, it must, of\\ncourse, be at your expense, sir.\"\\n\\nMr. Fudby bristled.\\n\\n\"At _my_ expense, sir? Do ye say at _my_ expense? I am surprised! I\\nrepeat--I am surprised!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, sir? I can order the town-crier out, describing the horse,\\nand--er--offering a reward for the capture of any man on such an\\nanimal. But--\" he shrugged and looked across at the town-clerk--\"I do\\nnot imagine that \\'twould be of much use--eh, Mr. Brand?\"\\n\\nThe clerk pursed his lips and spread out his hands.\\n\\n\"I fear not; I very much fear not. I would advise Mr. Fudby to have a\\nproclamation posted up round the country.\" He sat back with the air of\\none who has contributed his share to the work, and does not intend to\\noffer any more help.\\n\\n\"Ho!\" growled Mr. Fudby. He blew out his cheeks. \"\\'Twill be a grievous\\nexpense, though I suppose it must be done, and I cannot but feel that if\\nit had not been for your deplorably cowardly conduct, Chilter--yes,\\ncowardly conduct, I say--I might never have been robbed of my two\\nhundred!\" He snuffled a little, and eyed the flushed but silent Chilter\\nwith mingled reproach and scorn. \"However, my coachman assures me he\\ncould swear to the horse again, although he cannot remember much about\\nthe man himself. Chilter! How did he describe the horse?\"\\n\\n\"Oh--er--chestnut, Mr. Fudby--chestnut, with a half-moon of white on its\\nforehead, and one white foreleg.\"\\n\\nJack perceived that it was time he took a hand in the game. He half\\nturned in his chair and levelled his quizzing-glass at Mr. Chilter.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon?\" he drawled.\\n\\nMr. Fudby\\'s eye brightened. The fine gentleman was roused to an\\nexpression of interest at last. He launched forth into his story once\\nmore for my lord\\'s benefit. Carstares eyed him coldly, seeing which, Mr.\\nHedges came hurriedly to the rescue.\\n\\n\"Er--yes, Mr. Fudby--quite so! Your pardon, sir, I have not the honour\\nof knowing your name?\"\\n\\n\"Ferndale,\" supplied Jack, \"Sir Anthony Ferndale.\"\\n\\n\"Er--yes--\" Mr. Hedges bowed. \"Pray pardon my importuning you with\\nour--\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" said my lord.\\n\\n\"No--quite so--The fact is, these--er--gentlemen have had\\nthe--er--misfortune to be waylaid on their journey here.\"\\n\\nSir Anthony\\'s glass was again levelled at the group. His expression\\nbetokened mild surprise.\\n\\n\"_All_ these gentlemen?\" he inquired blandly. \"Dear, dear!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, no, no, sir! Not all--Only Mr.--er--\"\\n\\n\"Fudby,\" said that worthy, and discovered that Sir Anthony was bowing\\nfrigidly. At once he rose, and resting his knuckles on the table before\\nhim, bent his body slowly and painfully. Sir Anthony inclined his head.\\nWhereupon, to the delight of all the rest, Mr. Fudby bowed again with\\neven greater stateliness than before. Mr. Hedges observed Sir Anthony\\'s\\nlips to twitch convulsively. He waited for Mr. Fudby to subside, and\\nthen continued:\\n\\n\"Yes--Mr. Fudby and Mr.--\"\\n\\n\"My clerk!\" snapped Fudby.\\n\\nSir Anthony favoured Mr. Chilter with his peculiarly sweet smile, and\\nturned again to Mr. Hedges.\\n\\n\"I see. A _daylight_ robbery, you say?\"\\n\\n\"Broad daylight!\" boomed Mr. Fudby.\\n\\n\"Er--yes, yes,\" interposed the mayor, fearing a fresh outbreak from that\\nquarter. \"I wonder if you have seen anything of such an animal as\\nMr.--er--Chilter--described?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a most extraordinary thing,\" said Carstares slowly, \"but I have\\njust bought such an one.\" He glanced round with an inquiring smile and\\none eyebrow lifted.\\n\\n\"Well!\" ejaculated Mr. Fudby. \"Well!\"\\n\\n\"Dear me, sir, what a strange coincidence! May I ask where you bought\\nit, and from whom?\"\\n\\n\"She has not been in my possession over two hours. I bought her from an\\nout-at-elbows ruffian, on my way hither. I thought at one time that\\n\\'twas strange that the man should possess such a mare--pure bred, I\\nvow--and wondered why he was so eager to be rid of her.\"\\n\\n\"He was eager because he knew he would be recognised by her,\" explained\\nMr. Fudby kindly.\\n\\n\"Without doubt. Perhaps you would like to see her? I will send my man--\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, no!\" cried the mayor. \"We would not dream of so inconveniencing\\nyou--\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twere a pleasure,\" bowed Jack, devoutly hoping that Mr. Fudby would\\nnot require to see Jenny, who, he felt sure, would betray him by her\\nvery evident affection.\\n\\n\"No, no, Sir Anthony, \\'tis quite unnecessary, I assure you, but I thank\\nyou for all that. Mr. Fudby, if you would describe the man himself, I\\nwill see to the proclamation.\"\\n\\n\"Describe him, Chilter!\" ordered Mr. Fudby, who was becoming rather\\ngrumpy.\\n\\nMr. Chilter smiled suddenly.\\n\\n\"Certainly, sir!\" he said with alacrity. \"\\'Twas a great ruffianly\\nfellow, monstrous tall--\"\\n\\n\"How tall?\" interrupted the town-clerk. \"Six feet?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, quite!\" lied Mr. Chilter. \"And fat.\"\\n\\nJack\\'s shoulders shook.\\n\\n\"Fat, you say?\" he asked gently.\\n\\n\"Very fat,\" affirmed Mr. Chilter. \"And prodigious rough, swearing\\ndreadfully in his speech.\"\\n\\n\"You could not see his face, I suppose?\"\\n\\nMr. Chilter hesitated.\\n\\n\"I could see his mouth and chin,\" he said, \"and I remarked a long scar\\nrunning from his under-lip to the--er--bottom of his face.\"\\n\\nInvoluntarily Carstares\\' hand caressed his perfectly smooth chin. Either\\nthe little clerk was a born romancer, or for some reason or other he did\\nnot want the highwayman to be taken.\\n\\n\"Well, Sir Anthony?\" the mayor was saying. \"Does that description fit\\nyour man?\"\\n\\nMy lord frowned thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"Tall,\" he said slowly, \"and fat--you said fat, I think, Mr. Chilter?\"\\n\\nRather anxiously Mr. Chilter reiterated this statement.\\n\\n\"Ah! And with a long scar--yes, that is undoubtedly he. Furthermore,\" he\\nadded audaciously, \"he has a squint in his left eye. \\'Tis a most\\nill-favoured rogue in all.\"\\n\\n\"It would appear so, Sir Anthony,\" remarked the mayor drily. He did not\\nin the least believe the story of the squint, and imagined that the fine\\ncourt gentleman was amusing himself at their expense. Nevertheless, he\\nhad no intention of remonstrating; the sooner he could withdraw from\\nthis very tiresome affair the better. So he gravely took down all the\\nabsurd particulars, remarked that the man should be easy to find, and\\nmade ready to depart.\\n\\nThe town-clerk rose, and tapped the beadle on the shoulder, whereupon\\nthat worthy, with a grunt, abandoned his pose of masterly inactivity and\\nfollowed the mayor out of the room.\\n\\nMr. Fudby rose.\\n\\n\"I doubt I shall never see my money again,\" he said pettishly. \"If you,\\nChilter had not been so--\"\\n\\n\"Allow me to offer you some snuff, Mr. Chilter,\" interposed my lord\\ngently, extending his jewelled box. \"Doubtless, sir, you would wish to\\nsee my mare?\"\\n\\n\"I know nought of horses,\" snorted Mr. Fudby. \"\\'Tis my clerk who appears\\nto have remarked all the details.\" He sneered terrifically.\\n\\n\"Then pray, do me the honour of walking as far as the stables, Mr.\\nChilter. \\'Twere as well to be certain about the mare. Mr.-ah--Fudby,\\nyour servant.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"And now, Mr. Chilter, I have a grudge against you,\" said Carstares, as\\nthey walked across the little garden.\\n\\n\"Me, sir? Oh--er--have you, Sir Anthony?\"\\n\\nHe looked up and perceived that the gentleman was laughing.\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr. Chilter, a very serious grudge: you have described me as fat!\"\\n\\nChilter nearly fainted.\\n\\n\"_You_, sir,\" he gasped, and stared in amazement.\\n\\n\"Also that I swear dreadfully in my speech, and that I have a scar\\nrunning from my mouth to my chin.\"\\n\\nMr. Chilter stood stock-still in the middle of the path.\\n\\n\"It was you, sir, all the time? _You_ held us up? Were _you_ the man who\\nwrenched open the door?\"\\n\\n\"I was that infamous scoundrel. I beg leave once more to apologise for\\nmy carelessness in opening that same door. Now tell me, why did you\\ntake such pains to throw dust in their sleepy eyes?\"\\n\\nThey resumed their walk slowly. The little clerk flushed.\\n\\n\"I scarce know, sir, save that I--that I liked you, and--and--\"\\n\\n\"I see. \\'Twas prodigious good of you, Mr. Chilter. I wonder if there is\\nanything that I can do to show my gratitude?\"\\n\\nAgain the clerk flushed and lifted his head proudly.\\n\\n\"I thank you, sir, but there is nought.\"\\n\\nBy now they had reached the stable. Carstares opened the door and they\\nentered.\\n\\n\"Then will you accept this in token of my regard, sir?\"\\n\\nMr. Chilter gazed at the emerald ring that glowed and winked at him from\\nthe palm of my lord\\'s hand. He looked up into the blue eyes and\\nstammered a little.\\n\\n\"Indeed, sir--I--I--\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis honestly come by!\" pleadingly. \"Come, Mr. Chilter, you\\'ll not hurt\\nmy feelings by refusing? You will keep it in remembrance of a man--a fat\\nman, Mr. Chilter--who rudely jerked you on to the road?\"\\n\\nThe clerk took it with unsteady fingers.\\n\\n\"I thank you most--\"\\n\\n\"Nay, I beg of you. \\'Tis I thank you for aiding me so kindly.... Come\\nand see my Jenny! Well, lass?\" For the mare at the first sound of his\\nvoice had turned in her loose-box, and was whinnying and pawing the\\nground eagerly.\\n\\n\"I do not understand, sir, anything: how it is that you are a\\nhighwayman, or why you have honoured me with your confidence--why you\\nshould trust me. But--thank you.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke, Mr. Chilter placed his hand in my lord\\'s, and for the\\nsecond time in his life, felt the pressure of those firm, kindly\\nfingers.\\n\\n\"Why, your honour! Ye\\'ve lost your emerald!\"\\n\\n\"No, Jim. I gave it away.\"\\n\\n\"Ye--ye _gave_ it away, sir?\"\\n\\n\"M\\'m. To the small spider.\"\\n\\n\"B-but--\"\\n\\n\"And he called me fat, too.\"\\n\\n\"Called ye fat, sir?\" asked the man, bewildered.\\n\\n\"Yes. Very fat. By the way, let me tell you that I bought Jenny at\\nFittering to-day from the naughty ruffian who waylaid Mr. Bumble Bee.\"\\nHe proceeded to give Jim a sketch of what had transpired below. When he\\nhad finished the man shook his head severely.\\n\\n\"I doubt ye\\'ll never learn wisdom, sir,\" he scolded.\\n\\n\"I? What have I done?\"\\n\\n\"What did ye want to tell it all to the spider man for, sir? \\'Twas most\\nincautious of ye. Like as not, he\\'ll split to the fat gentleman, and\\nwe\\'ll have the whole town at our heels.\"\\n\\n\"Which just shows all you know of the small spider,\" replied his master\\ncalmly. \"Hand me the powder.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\nINTRODUCING THE HON. RICHARD CARSTARES\\n\\n\\nWyncham! A stately old house with mullioned windows, standing high on\\nits stone terraces, half-covered by creepers; a house surrounded by\\nlawns, rolling down on the one side to a river that rippled and murmured\\nits way along beneath overhanging trees and a blue sky, over boulders\\nand rocks, so clear and sparkling that the myriad pebbles could be seen\\ndeep down on its bed.\\n\\nIn the other direction, the velvet lawns stretched away till they met\\nthe orchards and the quiet meadowland.\\n\\nOn two sides the house had its terraces, very white in the sunshine,\\nwith stone steps leading down to a miniature lake where water-lilies\\ngrew, and where the tiny fish darted to and fro unconcernedly.\\n\\nFlagged walks there were, running between flower beds a riot of colour,\\nand solemn old trees that had stood there through all the years. Cool\\nwoodland lay beyond the little river, carpeted with dark moss, where in\\nspring the primroses grew. So thick was the foliage of the trees that\\nthe sun but penetrated in uneven patches.\\n\\nUp the terrace walls crept roses, yellow and red, pink and white, and\\ntossed their trailing sprays across the parapet. Over the walls of the\\nhouse they climbed, mingling with purple clematis, jasmine, and sickly\\nhoneysuckle. The air was heavy with their united perfumes, while, wafted\\nfrom a bed below, came the smoky scent of lavender.\\n\\nThe old house seemed half asleep, basking in the sunlight. Save for a\\npeacock preening its feathers on the terrace steps, there was no sign of\\nlife....\\n\\nThe old place had harboured generations of Carstares. Earl had succeeded\\nEarl and reigned supreme, and it was only now that there was no Earl\\nliving there. No one knew where he was. Scarce a month ago one died, but\\nthe eldest son was not there to take his place. For six years he had\\nbeen absent, and none dared breathe his name, for he disgraced that\\nname, and the old Earl cast him off and forbade all mention of him. But\\nthe poor folk of the countryside remembered him. They would tell one\\nanother tales of his reckless courage; his sweet smile and his winning\\nways; his light-heartedness and his never-failing kindness and\\ngood-humour. What a rider he was! To see him sit his horse! What a\\nswordsman! Do ye mind the time he fought young Mr. Welsh over yonder in\\nthe spinney with half the countryside watching? Ah, he was a one, was\\nMaster Jack! Do ye mind how he knocked the sword clean out o\\' Mr.\\nWelsh\\'s hand, and then stood waiting for him to pick it up? And do ye\\nmind the way his eyes sparkled, and how he laughed, just for the sheer\\njoy o\\' living?\\n\\nEndless anecdotes would they tell, and the old gaffers would shake their\\nheads and sigh, and long for the sight of him again. And they would jerk\\ntheir thumbs towards the Manor and shrug their old shoulders\\nsignificantly. Who wanted Mr. Richard for squire? Not they, at least.\\nThey knew he was a good squire and a kindly man, but give them Master\\nJohn, who would laugh and crack a joke and never wear the glum looks\\nthat Mr. Richard affected.\\n\\nIn the house, Richard Carstares paced to and fro in his library, every\\nnow and again pausing to glance wretchedly up at the portrait of his\\nbrother hanging over his desk. The artist had managed to catch the\\nexpression of those blue eyes, and they smiled down at Richard in just\\nthe way that John was always wont to smile--so gaily, and withal so\\nwistfully.\\n\\nRichard was twenty-nine, but already he looked twice his age. He was\\nvery thin, and there were deep lines on his good-looking countenance.\\nHis grey eyes bore a haunted, care-worn look, and his mouth, though\\nwell-shaped, was curiously lacking in determination. He was dressed\\nsoberly, and without that touch of smartness that had characterised him\\nsix years ago. He wore black in memory of his father, and it may have\\nbeen that severity, only relieved by the lace at his throat, that made\\nhis face appear so prematurely aged. There was none of his brother\\'s\\nboyishness about him; even his smile seemed forced and tired, and his\\nlaughter rarely held merriment.\\n\\nHe pulled out his chronometer, comparing it with the clock on the\\nmantelpiece. His pacing took him to the door, and almost nervously he\\npulled it open, listening.\\n\\nNo sound came to his ears. Back again, to and fro across the room,\\neagerly awaiting the clanging of a bell. It did not come, but presently\\na footfall sounded on the passage without, and someone knocked at the\\ndoor.\\n\\nIn two strides Richard was by it, and had flung it wide. Warburton stood\\nthere.\\n\\nRichard caught his hand.\\n\\n\"Warburton! At last! I have been waiting this hour and more!\"\\n\\nMr. Warburton disengaged himself, bowing.\\n\\n\"I regret I was not able to come before, sir,\" he said primly.\\n\\n\"I make no doubt you travelled back as quickly as possible--come in,\\nsir.\"\\n\\nHe led the lawyer into the room and shut the door.\\n\\n\"Sit down, Warburton--sit down. You--you found my brother?\"\\n\\nAgain Warburton bowed.\\n\\n\"I had the felicity of seeing his lordship, sir.\"\\n\\n\"He was well? In good spirits? You thought him changed--yes? Aged\\nperhaps, or--\"\\n\\n\"His lordship was not greatly changed, sir.\"\\n\\nRichard almost stamped in his impatience.\\n\\n\"Come, Warburton, come! Tell me everything. What did he say? Will he\\ntake the revenues? Will he--\"\\n\\n\"His lordship, sir, was reluctant to take anything, but upon maturer\\nconsideration, he--ah--consented to accept his elder son\\'s portion. The\\nrevenues of the estate he begs you will make use of.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! But you told him that I would touch nought belonging to him?\"\\n\\n\"I tried to persuade his lordship, sir. To no avail. He desires you to\\nuse Wyncham as you will.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll not touch his money!\"\\n\\nWarburton gave the faintest of shrugs.\\n\\n\"That is as you please, sir.\"\\n\\nSomething in the suave voice made Richard, from his stand by the desk,\\nglance sharply down at the lawyer. Suspicion flashed into his eyes. He\\nseemed about to speak, when Warburton continued:\\n\\n\"I believe I may set your mind at rest on one score, Mr. Carstares: his\\nlordship\\'s situation is tolerably comfortable. He has ample means.\"\\n\\n\"But--but he lives by--robbery!\"\\n\\nWarburton\\'s thin lips curled a little.\\n\\n\"Does he not?\" persisted Carstares.\\n\\n\"So he would have us believe, sir.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis true! He--waylaid me!\"\\n\\n\"And robbed you, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Rob me? He could not rob his own brother, Warburton!\"\\n\\n\"Your pardon, Mr. Carstares--you are right: his lordship could not rob a\\nbrother. Yet have I known a man do such a thing.\"\\n\\nFor a long minute there was no word spoken. The suspicion that had dwelt\\nlatent in Carstares\\' eyes sprang up again. Some of the colour drained\\nfrom his cheeks, and twice he passed his tongue between his lips. The\\nfingers of his hand, gripping a chair-back, opened and shut\\nspasmodically. Rather feverishly his eyes searched the lawyer\\'s face,\\nquestioning.\\n\\n\"John told you--told you--\" he started, and floundered hopelessly.\\n\\n\"His lordship told me nothing, sir. He was singularly reticent. But\\nthere was nothing he could tell me that I did not already know.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Warburton? Why do you look at me like that? Why do\\nyou fence with me? In plain words, what do you mean?\"\\n\\nWarburton rose, clenching his hands.\\n\\n\"I know you, Master Richard, for what you are!\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" Carstares flung out his hand as if to ward off a blow.\\n\\nAnother tense silence. With a great effort Warburton controlled himself,\\nand once more the mask of impassivity seemed to descend upon him. After\\nthat one tortured cry Richard became calm again. He sat down; on his\\nface a look almost of relief, coming after a great strain.\\n\\n\"You learnt the truth ... from John. He ... will expose me?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir. I have not learnt it from him. And he will never expose you.\"\\n\\nRichard turned his head. His eyes, filled now with a species of dull\\npain, looked full into Warburton\\'s.\\n\\n\"Oh?\" he said. \"Then you...?\"\\n\\n\"Nor I, sir. I have pledged my word to his lordship. I would not speak\\nall these years for your father\\'s sake--now it is for his.\" He choked.\\n\\n\"You ... are fond of John?\" Still the apathetic, weary voice.\\n\\n\"Fond of him--? Good God, Master Dick, I love him!\"\\n\\n\"And I,\" said Richard, very low.\\n\\nHe received no reply, and looked up.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t believe me?\"\\n\\n\"Once, sir, I was certain of it. Now--!\" he shrugged.\\n\\n\"Yet \\'tis true, Warburton. I would give all in my power to undo that\\nnight\\'s work.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot expect me to believe that, sir. It rests with you alone\\nwhether his name be cleared or not. And you remain silent.\"\\n\\n\"Warburton, I--Oh, do you think it means nothing to me that John is\\noutcast?\"\\n\\nBefore the misery in those grey eyes some of Warburton\\'s severity fell\\naway from him.\\n\\n\"Master Richard, I want to think the best I can of you. Master Jack\\nwould tell me nothing. Will you not--can you not explain how it came\\nthat you allowed him to bear the blame of your cheat?\"\\n\\nRichard shuddered.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no explanation--no excuse. I forced it on him! On Jack, my\\nbrother! Because I was mad for love of Lavinia--Oh, my God, the thought\\nof it is driving me crazed! I thought I could forget; and then--and\\nthen--I met him! The sight of him brought it all back to me. Ever since\\nthat day I have not known how to live and not shriek the truth to\\neveryone! And I never shall! I never shall!\"\\n\\n\"Tell me, sir,\" pleaded Warburton, touched in spite of himself.\\n\\nRichard\\'s head sunk into his hands.\\n\\n\"The whole scene is a nightmare.... I think I must have been mad.... I\\nscarce knew what I was about. I--\"\\n\\n\"Gently, sir. Remember I know hardly anything. What induced you to mark\\nthe cards?\"\\n\\n\"That debt to Gundry. My father would not meet it; I had to find the\\nmoney. I could not face the scandal--I tell you I was mad for Lavinia! I\\ncould think of nought else. I ceased to care for John because I thought\\nhim in love with her. I could not bear to think of the disgrace which\\nwould take her from me.... Then that night at Dare\\'s. I was losing; I\\nknew I could not pay. Gad! but I can see my notes of hand under\\nMilward\\'s elbow, growing... growing.\\n\\n\"Jack had played Milward before me, and he had won. I remember they\\nlaughed at him, saying his luck had turned at last--for he always lost\\nat cards. Milward and I played with the same pack that they had\\nused.... There was another table, I think. Dare was dicing with\\nFitzgerald; someone was playing faro with Jack behind me. I heard Jack\\nsay his luck was out again--I heard them laugh.... And all the time I\\nwas losing ... losing.\\n\\n\"The pin of my cravat fell out on to my knee. I think no one saw it. As\\nI picked it up the thought that I should mark the cards seemed to flash\\ninto my mind--oh, it was despicable, I know! I held the ace of clubs in\\nmy hand: I scratched it with that pin--in one corner. It was easily\\ndone. By degrees I marked all four, and three of the kings.\\n\\n\"No one noticed, but I was nervous--I dared do no more. I replaced that\\npin. Soon I began to win--not very much. Then Tracy Belmanoir came\\nacross the room to watch our play. From that moment everything seemed to\\ngo awry. It was the beginning of the trouble.\\n\\n\"Tracy stood behind me watching.... I could feel him there, like some\\nblack moth, hovering.... I don\\'t know how long he stayed like that--it\\nseemed hours. I could feel his eyes.... I could have shrieked--I\\'ll\\nswear my hands were trembling.\\n\\n\"Suddenly he moved. I had played the ace of hearts. He said: \\'One\\nmoment!\\' in that soft, sinister voice of his.\\n\\n\"Milward was surprised. I tried to tell myself that Devil had noticed\\nnothing.... The mark on that card was so faint that I could scarce see\\nit myself. I thought it impossible that he, a mere onlooker, should\\ndiscover it. He stepped forward. I remember he brushed my shoulder. I\\nremember how the light caught the diamonds he was wearing. I think my\\nbrain was numbed. I could only repeat to myself: \\'Extravagant Devil!\\nExtravagant Devil!\\' and stare at those winking jewels. Then I thought:\\n\\'He is Lavinia\\'s brother, but I do not like him; I do not like him...\\'\\n--little foolish things like that--and my throat was dry--parched.\\n\\n\"He bent over the table ... stretched out his white, white hand ...\\nturned over the ace ... lifted his quizzing glass ... and stared down at\\nthe card. Then he dropped the glass and drew out his snuff-box.... It\\nhad Aphrodite enamelled on the lid. I remember it so distinctly.... I\\nheard Tracy ask Milward to examine the ace. I wanted to spring up and\\nstrangle him.... I could scarce keep my hands still.\" Richard paused. He\\ndrew his hand across his eyes, shuddering.\\n\\n\"Milward saw the scratch. He cried out that the cards were marked!\\nSuddenly everyone seemed to be gathered about our table--all talking!\\nJack had his hand on my shoulder; he and Dare were running through the\\npack. But all the while I could look at no one but Tracy--Andover. He\\nseemed so sinister, so threatening, in those black clothes of his. His\\neyes were almost shut--his face so white. And he was looking at me! He\\nseemed to be reading my very soul.... For an instant I thought he knew!\\nI wanted to shout out that he was wrong! I wanted to shriek to him to\\ntake his eyes away! Heaven knows what I should have done!... but he\\nlooked away--at Jack, with that sneering smile on his damned mask of a\\nface! I could have killed him for that smile! I think Jack understood\\nit--he dropped the cards, staring at Tracy.\\n\\n\"Everyone was watching them ... no one looked at me. If they had they\\nmust surely have learnt the truth; but they were hanging on Andover\\'s\\nlips, looking from him to Jack and back again.... I remember Fitzgerald\\ndropped his handkerchief--I was absurdly interested in that. I was\\nwondering why he did not pick it up, when Andover spoke again.... \\'And\\nCarstares\\' luck turned...?\\' Like that, Warburton! With just that faint,\\nquestioning in his voice.\\n\\n\"Before Jack could speak there was an outcry. Dare cried \\'Shame!\\' to\\nAndover. They laughed at him, as well they might. But I saw them\\nexchange glances--they were wondering.... It was suspicious that Jack\\nshould have had that run of luck--and that he should lose as soon as he\\nleft that table.\\n\\n\"Milward--poor, silly Milward--gaped at Tracy and stuttered that surely\\n\\'twas another pack we had used. I could hardly breathe! Then Andover\\ncorrected him--How did he _know_? No one else remembered, or thought of\\nnoticing--only he!\\n\\n\"I can see Jack now, standing there so stiffly, with his head thrown up,\\nand those blue eyes of his flashing.\\n\\n\"\\'Do I understand you to accuse me, Belmanoir?\\' he said. Oh, but he was\\nfurious!\\n\\n\"Tracy never said a word. Only his eyes just flickered to my face and\\naway again.\\n\\n\"Jack\\'s hand was gripping my shoulder hard. I could feel his anger....\\nDare called out that the suggestion was preposterous. That John should\\ncheat!\\n\\n\"Tracy asked him if the cards were his. Gad! I can hear his soft,\\nmocking voice now!\\n\\n\"Dare went purple--you know his way, Warburton.\\n\\n\"\\'Opened in your presence on this table!\\' he cried.\\n\\n\"\\'By Carstares!\\' smiled Tracy.\\n\\n\"It was true. But why should Tracy remember it, and none other? They\\nstared at him, amazed. Dare turned to Jack for corroboration. He nodded.\\nI think he never looked haughtier....\\n\\n\"You know how fond of Jack Dare was? He tried to bluster it off--tried\\nto get control over the affair. It was to no avail. We were puppets,\\nworked by that devil, Belmanoir! One man managing that ghastly scene....\\nHe pointed out that only three of us had used that pack: Jack, Milward\\nand I.\\n\\n\"Jack laughed.\\n\\n\"\\'Next you will accuse Dick!\\' he snapped scornfully.\\n\\n\"\\'One of you, certainly,\\' smiled Andover. \\'Or Milward.\\'\\n\\n\"Then everyone realised that one of us three must have marked the cards.\\nMilward was upset, but no one suspected him. It was Jack--or me.\\n\\n\"As long as I live I shall never forget the horror of those moments. If\\nI were exposed it meant the end of everything between Lavinia and me. I\\ntell you, Warburton, I would have committed any sin at that moment!\\nNothing would have been too black--I could not bear to lose her. You\\ndon\\'t know what she meant to me!\"\\n\\n\"I can guess, sir,\" said the lawyer, gravely.\\n\\n\"No, no! No one could imagine the depths of my love for her! I think not\\neven Jack.... I felt his hand leave my shoulder.... The truth had dawned\\non him. I heard the way the breath hissed between his teeth as he\\nrealised.... Somehow I got to my feet, clutching at the table, facing\\nhim. I don\\'t excuse myself--I know my conduct was beyond words\\ndastardly. I looked across at him--just said his name, as though I could\\nscarce believe my ears. So all those watching thought. But Jack knew\\nbetter. He knew I was imploring him to save me. He understood all that I\\nwas trying to convey to him. For an instant he stared at me. I\\nthought--I thought--God forgive me, I prayed that he might take the\\nblame on himself. Then he smiled. Coward though I was, when I saw that\\nhurt, wistful little smile on his lips, I nearly blurted out the whole\\ntruth. Not quite.... I suppose I was too mean-spirited for that.\\n\\n\"Jack bowed to the room and again to Dare. He said: \\'I owe you an\\napology, sir.\\'\\n\\n\"Dare sprang forward, catching him by the shoulder--crying out that it\\ncould not be true! When Jack laughed--he fell away from him as from the\\nplague. And all of them! My God, to see them drawing away--not looking\\nat Jack! And Jack\\'s face--growing paler and harder ... every moment....\\nAll his friends... turning their backs to him. Davenant--even Jim\\nDavenant walked away to the fireplace with Evans.\\n\\n\"I could not look at Jack. I dared not. I could not go to him--stand by\\nhim! I had not the right. I had to leave him there--in the middle of the\\nroom--alone. The awful hurt in his eyes made me writhe. The room was\\nwhirling round--I felt sick--I know I fell back into my chair, hiding my\\nface. I hardly cared whether they suspected me or not. But they did not.\\nThey knew how great was the love between us, and they were not surprised\\nthat I broke down.\\n\\n\"I heard Andover\\'s soft voice ... he was telling some tale to Dare. Oh,\\nthey were well-bred those men! They skimmed over the unpleasant little\\nepisode--ignored Jack!\\n\\n\"Jack spoke again. I could guess how bravely he was keeping a proud\\nfront. I know word for word what he said: \\'Mr. Dare, your Grace,\\nGentlemen--my apologies for being the cause of so unpleasant an\\nincident. Pray give me leave.\\'\\n\\n\"They paid no heed. I heard him walk to the door--heard him open it. I\\ncould not look at him. He--he paused ... and said just one word: \\'Dick!\\'\\nquite softly. Heaven knows how I got to him! I know I overturned my\\nchair. That drew Dare\\'s attention. He said: \\'You are not going, Dick?\\' I\\nshouted \\'Yes,\\' at him, and then Jack took my arm, leading me out.\\n\\n\"And--and all he said was: \\'Poor old Dick!\\'... He--he had no word of\\nblame for me. He would not allow me to go back and tell the truth--as I\\nwould have done. Ay, Warburton, when Jack called me to him, I could have\\ncried it aloud--but--he would not have it.... He said: \\'For Lavinia\\'s\\nsake.\\'...\"\\n\\nWarburton blew his nose violently. His fingers were trembling.\\n\\n\"You know what happened afterwards. You know how my father turned Jack\\nout penniless--you know how his friends shunned him--you know my poor\\nmother\\'s grief. And you know that he went away--that we could not find\\nhim when--my mother died.... His last words to me--were: \\'Make\\nLavinia-happy--and try to forget--all this.\\' Forget it! Heavens! Try as\\nI might, I could hear nothing further of him until two months ago, when\\nhe--waylaid me. Then I was half-dazed at the suddenness of it. He--he\\ngrasped my hand--and--laughed! It was so dark, I could scarce see him. I\\nonly had time to demand his address, and then--he was off--galloping\\naway over the heath. I think--even then--he bore no malice.\"\\n\\n\"He does not now!\" said Warburton sharply. \"But, Master Dick, if all\\nthis is true, why do you not even now clear him? Surely--\"\\n\\nRichard turned his head slowly.\\n\\n\"Now I may not drag my wife\\'s name through the mud. By clearing him--I\\nruin her.\"\\n\\nWarburton could find nothing to say. Only after some time did he clear\\nhis throat and say that he was honoured by Carstares\\' confidence.\\n\\n\"You--ah--you dwell on the part played by his Grace on that evening.\\nSurely your--shall we say--overwrought imagination magnified that?\"\\n\\nRichard was disinterested.\\n\\n\"I suppose so. Mayhap \\'twas his extraordinary personality dominating me.\\nHe cannot have pulled the wires as I thought he did. Not even Belmanoir\\ncould make me act as I did. But--but at the time I felt that he was\\npushing--pushing--compelling me to accuse Jack. Oh, doubtless I was\\nmad!\"\\n\\nWarburton eyed the dejected figure compassionately. Then he seemed to\\nharden himself and to regain some of his lost primness of manner.\\n\\n\"You--ah--you are determined not to accept the revenues, sir?\"\\n\\n\"I have not yet sunk so low, Mr. Warburton.\"\\n\\n\"His lordship leaves Wyncham and all appertaining to it at your\\ndisposal. He would be grieved at your refusal.\"\\n\\n\"I will not touch it.\"\\n\\nThe lawyer nodded.\\n\\n\"I confess, Mr. Carstares, I am relieved to hear you say that. It will\\nnot be necessary again to communicate with his lordship. I think he does\\nnot desire any intercourse with--his family. He finds it too painful.\\nBut he wished to be remembered to you, sir. Also to her ladyship.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.... You could--ascertain nothing of his situation? He did not\\nconfide in you?\"\\n\\n\"He was very reticent, sir. I think he is not unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"And not--embittered?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not that, sir.\"\\n\\nMr. Warburton rose, plainly anxious to be gone.\\n\\nReluctantly Richard followed his example.\\n\\n\"You--have nothing further to tell me of him?\"\\n\\n\"I regret, sir--nothing.\"\\n\\nRichard went slowly to the door, and opened it.\\n\\n\"You must allow me to thank you, sir, for your goodness in undertaking\\nwhat I know must have been a painful task. I am very grateful.\"\\n\\nMr. Warburton bowed low.\\n\\n\"I beg you will not mention it, sir. Nothing I might do for the\\nCarstares could be aught but a pleasure.\"\\n\\nAgain he bowed, and the next instant was gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\nINTRODUCING THE LADY LAVINIA CARSTARES\\n\\n\\nRichard went slowly back to his chair. After a moment he sat down,\\nstaring blankly out of the window, his hands loosely clasped on the desk\\nbefore him. So he remained for a long while, immobile. At last, with the\\nfaintest of sighs, he moved and picked up a quill. He dipped it in the\\nink, and, with his other hand, drew towards him a sheaf of papers.\\nPresently he was writing steadily.\\n\\nFor perhaps twenty minutes the quill travelled to and fro across the\\npages; then it paused, and Richard looked up towards the door.\\n\\nIt opened to admit Lady Lavinia. She came rustling into the room with\\nher embroidery in her hand. She dropped her husband a mock curtsey and\\nwent over to a high-backed armchair, stretching out a dimpled hand to\\ndraw it forward. But even as her fingers touched it she had changed her\\nmind, and fluttered over to the couch, there to seat herself with much\\nswirling of brocades and arrangement of skirts. She then proceeded to\\noccupy herself with her work, plying her needle hurriedly and jerkily.\\n\\nRichard watched her in silence, following each turn of the pretty hand\\nand each movement of her fair head.\\n\\nThe silence was evidently not to my lady\\'s taste, for she presently\\nbegan to beat an impatient tattoo on the floor with one slender foot.\\nStill he said nothing, and she raised her pure china-blue eyes to his\\nface.\\n\\n\"Why so glum, Dick? Why do you not talk to me?\" Her voice was rather\\nhigh-pitched and childish, and she had a curious way of ending each\\nsentence with an upward lilt and a long drawn-out accent, very\\nfascinating to listen to.\\n\\nRichard smiled with an obvious effort.\\n\\n\"Am I, my dear? I crave your pardon. Warburton has just been.\"\\n\\nHer face clouded over instantly, and the full-lipped mouth drooped\\npetulantly.\\n\\n\"He has seen him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh?\" She made the word twice its length, and filled it with\\ndisinterest.\\n\\n\"Yes. Jack will have none of it. He asks me to be his steward and to use\\nWyncham as I will. He is very generous.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, oh yes. And you will, Richard?\"\\n\\nHe ignored the question.\\n\\n\"He--Warburton--says he is not much changed.\"\\n\\n\"Oh?\" Again the long-drawn monosyllable, accompanied by a tiny yawn.\\n\\n\"He says he does not think--Jack--bears me ill-will--\" He paused, as if\\nexpecting her to speak, but she was absorbed in arranging two\\nflowers--culled from a bowl at her side--at her breast, and took no\\nnotice. Carstares turned his head away wearily.\\n\\n\"If it were not for you, my dear, I would tell the truth. I believe I\\nshall go crazed an I do not.\"\\n\\n\"Dick!\" ... She dropped the flowers on the floor and thought no more\\nabout them. \"Dick!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you need have no fear! I do not suppose,\" bitterly, \"that I have\\nthe courage to face them all now--after six years.\"\\n\\nLavinia moved restlessly, brushing her hand along the couch.\\n\\n\"You will not do it, Richard? Promise! You _will_ not? I could not bear\\nthe disgrace of it; promise me you will never do it?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" he said slowly, not looking at her. \"No, I cannot promise that.\"\\n\\nShe sprang to her feet, flinging her broidery from her carelessly, and\\nwaved fierce, agitated little hands.\\n\\n\"That means you will do it. You _want_ to disgrace me! You do not _care_\\nhow you hurt me by holding this threat over my head so cruelly! You--\"\\n\\n\"Lavinia, for heaven\\'s sake!\" he implored, pushing back his chair. \"Calm\\nyourself!\" He knew she was about to fly into one of her sudden passions,\\nand frowned with acute vexation.\\n\\n\"I will not! Oh yes, yes! You think me a shrew! I know! I know! But you\\nneed not frown on me, sir, for you are worse! No, I will not hush. I am\\na horrid woman, yes, but you are a cheat--a cheat--a cheat!\"\\n\\nCarstares strode over to her.\\n\\n\"Lavinia!\"\\n\\n\"No--no! Leave me alone! You make me miserable! You refuse me everything\\nthat I want most, and then you threaten to disgrace me--\"\\n\\n\"That is untrue!\" cried Richard, goaded into replying. \"I will not\\npromise, that is all. What have I refused you that was within my means\\nto give you? God knows you try your best to ruin me--\"\\n\\n\"There! There! \\'Tis _I_ who am to blame! Pray, did you not induce my\\nlord to leave his money to John when you knew he would have willed it\\nall to you an you had kept silence? You took no thought to me--\"\\n\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, Lavinia, be still! You do not know what you are\\nsaying!\"\\n\\nShe pressed her hands to her hot cheeks.\\n\\n\"No--I am unreasonable! I know it, but don\\'t _tell_ me so, for I cannot\\nbear it! And don\\'t look reproach at me, Richard! You drive me mad, I\\ntell you!\" She was sweeping up and down the room like some caged animal,\\nlashing herself to a worse fury.\\n\\n\"Say something, Richard! _Do_ something! Don\\'t stand there so quietly!\\nOh, you should never have married me! I displease you, and you make me\\nworse; and you do not see how \\'tis that I cannot live without pleasure,\\nand money! I am despicable? Yes, yes, but what are you? Oh, why did you\\ntell me you cheated _after_ you had wedded me?\" Angry sobs escaped her;\\nher handkerchief was in shreds upon the floor.\\n\\nCarstares turned his back to her, that she might not see how she had\\ncontrived to hurt him, and the movement drove her to fresh fury.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do that! Don\\'t! Don\\'t! You make me worse by your dreadful\\nsilence! Oh, if you really loved me!\"\\n\\n\"You cannot doubt that!\" he cried out, wheeling suddenly round. \"You\\nknow how I love you! Don\\'t you?\" He gripped her by the shoulders and\\nswung her to face him.\\n\\nShe trembled and gave a sobbing little laugh. As suddenly as it had\\ncome, her anger left her.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, yes! You do love me, Dicky?\" She twined her arms about his\\nneck and shrank closer.\\n\\n\"God help me, yes!\" he groaned, thrusting her away. \"And you--you care\\nfor no one save yourself!\"\\n\\n\"No! No!\" she cried, pressing up to him again. \"Do not say that, Dick.\\nIndeed, I love you, but I cannot live without gaiety--you know I\\ncannot. Oh, I do not doubt but what I am very selfish, but \\'tis the way\\nI am fashioned, and I cannot change my nature. And now I have hurt you,\\nand I did not mean to! I did not mean to!\"\\n\\n\"My dear, I know you did not; but try to be less a child, I beg of you!\\nYou are so uncontrolled, so--\"\\n\\n\"I knew you would say that,\" she answered in a dead voice. \"You do not\\nunderstand me. You expect me to be good, and patient, and forbearing,\\nand I tell you \\'tis not in my nature.\"\\n\\n\"But, Lavinia, you can control your passions,\" he said gently.\\n\\n\"No! I cannot! We Belmanoirs--as God made us, so we are--and He made us\\nspendthrift, and pleasure-loving, and mad!\" She walked slowly to the\\ndoor. \"But you do not understand, and you try to make me staid, and\\nthoughtful, and a good mother, when I am dying for _life_, and\\nexcitement, and care not that for housewifery!\" She opened the door\\nslowly. \"And now my head aches, and you look grave and say \\'tis my\\nwicked temper, when I want you to be sorry, and to be ready to do\\nanything to comfort me. Why can you not take me to London, when you know\\nhow I long to be there, instead of in this gloomy house with nought to\\ndo, save mind my child and my needle? I am so tired of it all! So very\\ntired of it all!\"\\n\\nShe would have left the room then, but he detained her.\\n\\n\"Wait, Lavinia! You say you are unhappy?\"\\n\\nShe released the door handle and fluttered her hands expressively.\\n\\n\"Unhappy? No, I am dull. I am ill-tempered. I am discontented. I am\\naught you please, so do not be sad, Richard. I cannot bear you to be\\nsolemn. Oh, why do we quarrel?\" With one of her impulsive movements she\\nwas again at his side, with her beautiful face upturned. \"Love me,\\nRichard! Take me to London and never mind an I _do_ squander your money.\\nSay you do not care! Say that nothing matters so long as I am happy! Why\\ndo you not say it? Does anything matter? Don\\'t be prudent, Dicky! Be\\nwild! Be reckless! Be anything rather than grave and old!\" Her arms\\ncrept up to his coaxingly. \"Take me to London!\"\\n\\nCarstares smoothed the soft hair back from her forehead, very tenderly,\\nbut his eyes were worried.\\n\\n\"My dear, I will take you, but not just yet. There is so much to be done\\nhere. If you will wait a little longer--\"\\n\\n\"Ah, if I will wait! If I will be patient and good! But I cannot! Oh,\\nyou don\\'t understand, Dicky--you don\\'t understand!\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry, dear. I promise I will take you as soon as possible, and we\\nwill stay as long as you please.\"\\n\\nHer arms fell away.\\n\\n\"I want to go now!\"\\n\\n\"Dear--\"\\n\\n\"Very well--very well. We will go presently. Only don\\'t reason with me.\"\\n\\nHe looked at her concernedly.\\n\\n\"You are overwrought, my love--and tired.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she agreed listlessly. \"Oh yes; I will go now and rest. Forgive\\nme, Dick!\" She kissed her finger-tips and extended them to him. \"I will\\nbe good one day.\" She turned and hurried out of the room and up the\\nstairs, leaving the door open behind her.\\n\\nRichard stayed for a moment looking round at the signs of her late\\npresence. Mechanically he stooped to pick up her embroidery and the\\npieces of her handkerchief. The two flowers were broken off short, and\\nhe threw them away. Then he left the room and went out on to the sunny\\nterrace, gazing across the beautiful gardens into the blue distance.\\n\\nAcross the lawn came a child of four or five, waving a grimy hand.\\n\\n\"Father!\"\\n\\nRichard looked down at him and smiled.\\n\\n\"Well, John?\"\\n\\nThe boy climbed up the terrace steps, calling his news all the way.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis Uncle Andrew, sir. He has rid over to see you, and is coming\\nthrough the garden to find you.\"\\n\\n\"Is he? Has he left his horse at the stables?\"\\n\\n\"Ay, sir. So I came to tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Quite right. Will you come with me to meet him?\"\\n\\nThe little rosy face lighted up with pleasure.\\n\\n\"Oh, may I?\" he cried and slipped his hand in Richard\\'s.\\n\\nTogether they descended the steps and made their way across the lawn.\\n\\n\"I have run away from Betty,\" announced John with some pride. \"There\\'s\\nUncle Andrew, sir!\" He bounded away towards the approaching figure.\\n\\nLord Andrew Belmanoir was Richard\\'s brother-in-law, brother to the\\npresent Duke. He came up with John in his arms and tumbled him to the\\nground.\\n\\n\"Good day, Dick! \\'Tis a spoilt child you have here!\"\\n\\n\"Ay. He is but now escaped from his nurse.\"\\n\\n\"Splendid! Come, John, you shall walk with us, and we\\'ll confound fat\\nBetty!\" He slipped his arm through Richard\\'s as he spoke. \"Come, Dick!\\nThere\\'s a deal I have to say to you.\" He grimaced ruefully.\\n\\nThe child ran on ahead towards the woods, a great bull-mastiff at his\\nheels.\\n\\n\"What\\'s to do now?\" asked Richard, looking round into the mobile,\\ndissipated countenance.\\n\\n\"The devil\\'s in it this time, and no mistake,\" answered his lordship\\nwith a rueful shake of his head.\\n\\n\"Debts?\"\\n\\n\"Lord, yes! I was at Delaby\\'s last night, and the stakes were high.\\nAltogether I\\'ve lost about three thousand--counting what I owe Carew.\\nAnd devil take me an I know where \\'tis to come from! Here\\'s Tracy turned\\nsaint and swears he\\'ll see me damned before he hands me another penny. I\\ndoubt he means it, too.\"\\n\\nTracy was the Duke. Richard smiled a little cynically; he had already\\nhad to lend his Grace a thousand guineas to pay off some \"trifling\\ndebt.\"\\n\\n\"He means it right enough. I believe it would puzzle him to find it.\"\\n\\n\"Do you say so? Why, \\'tis impossible man! Tracy was in town scarce a\\nfortnight since, and he had a run of the devil\\'s own luck. I tell you\\nDick, I saw him walk off with a cool five thousand one night! And then\\nhe denies me a paltry three! Lord, what a brother! And all with the air\\nof an angel, as if _he_ had never lost at dice. And a homily thrown in!\\nAnyone would think I had cheated, instead of--ahem!... Dick, I\\'m\\nconfoundedly sorry! Damned thoughtless of me--never thought about\\nJo--about what I was saying--I\\'m a fool!\" For Richard had winced.\\n\\n\"You cannot help that,\" he said, forcing a laugh. \"Have done with your\\napologies, and continue.\"\\n\\nThey had come to the stream by now, and crossed the little bridge into\\nthe wood.\\n\\n\"Oh, there\\'s not much more. \\'Tis only that something must be done, for\\nCarew won\\'t wait, and stap me if I\\'d ask him, the lean-faced\\nscarecrow!--so I came to you, Dick.\"\\n\\nHe let go Richard\\'s arm and flung himself down on a fallen tree-trunk,\\nregardless of velvet and laces.\\n\\n\"You\\'re a good fellow, and you don\\'t lecture a man as Tracy does, devil\\ntake him! And you play high yourself, or you did, though \\'tis an age\\nsince I saw you win or lose enough to wink at. And, after all, you\\'re\\nLavvy\\'s husband, and--oh, damn it all, Dick, \\'tis monstrous hard to ask\\nyou!\"\\n\\nCarstares, leaning against a tree, surveyed the youthful rake amusedly.\\n\\n\"\\'Tush, Andrew!\" he reassured him. \"You\\'re welcome to ask, but the Lord\\nknows where I\\'m to find it! Gad, what a life! Here\\'s Lavinia keeps\\nbuying silks, and I don\\'t know what all, and--\"\\n\\n\"She was ever a spendthrift jade,\" said Andrew with a mighty frown.\\n\\nRichard laughed at him.\\n\\n\"You\\'re a thrifty fellow yourself, of course!\"\\n\\nAndrew looked round for something to throw at him, and finding nothing,\\nrelapsed once more into deepest despondency.\\n\\n\"You\\'re in the right of\\'t. We\\'re a worthless lot. \\'Tis the old man\\'s\\nblood in us, I doubt not, with a smattering of her Grace. You never knew\\nmy mother, Richard. She was French--Lavvy\\'s the spit of her. There\\'s\\nTracy--stap me, but Tracy\\'s the very devil! Have you ever seen a face\\nlike his? No, I\\'ll swear you\\'ve not! What with his sneering mouth and\\nhis green eyes--oh, \\'tis enough to make a fellow go to the dogs to have\\na brother like it, \\'pon my soul it is! Ay, you laugh, but I tell you\\n\\'tis serious!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, go on!\"\\n\\n\"Well next there\\'s Bob--damn it all, but I\\'m sorry for Bob! \\'Tis a\\nbeggarly pittance they give one in the army, and he was never one to\\npinch and scrape. Well, as I say, there\\'s Bob, and I never see him, but\\nwhat it\\'s: \\'Lend me a hundred, Andy!\\' or the like. And all to buy his\\nmistress some gewgaw. That\\'s what sickens me! Why, Bob\\'s for ever in\\nsome scrape with a petticoat, and as for Tracy! Gad, how they can! Then\\nthere\\'s Lavinia, but I should think you know her by now, and lastly,\\nthere\\'s your humble servant. And I tell you, Dick, what with the racing,\\nand the cards, and the bottle, I shall be a ruined man before you can\\nturn round! And the pother is I\\'ll never be any different. \\'Tis in the\\nblood, so where\\'s the use in trying?\" He made a rueful grimace, and\\nrose. \"Come on, young rip! We\\'re going back.\"\\n\\nJohn, engaged in the task of hunting for tadpoles in the water some\\nyards distant, nodded and ran on.\\n\\n\"I fear my lady is indisposed,\" said Richard hesitatingly. \"You wished\\nto see her?\"\\n\\nAndrew winked knowingly.\\n\\n\"Tantrums, eh? Oh, I know her. No, I do not care an I do not see her;\\n\\'tis little enough she cares for me, though she\\'s as thick as thieves\\nwith Tracy--oh, ay, I\\'ll be dumb.\"\\n\\nThey walked slowly back to the house, Andrew, silent for once, twirling\\nhis gold-mounted cane.\\n\\n\"You shall have the money, of course. When do you want it?\" said Richard\\npresently.\\n\\n\"\\'Pon honour, you\\'re a devilish good fellow, Dick! But if \\'tis like to\\nput you to any--\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense. When do you need it?\"\\n\\n\"I should pay Carew as soon as may be. Markham can wait over if--\"\\n\\n\"No, no! Wednesday?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twill do excellently well. Dick, you\\'re a--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, pshaw! \\'Tis nought. I want your opinion on the bay mare I bought\\nlast week. You\\'ll maybe think her a trifle long in the leg, but she\\'s a\\nfine animal.\"\\n\\nJohn had run indoors, and the two men proceeded to the stables alone,\\nAndrew discoursing all the way, recounting for his brother-in-law\\'s\\nbenefit the choicest morsels of scandal that were circulating town at\\nthe moment. That his auditor but attended with half an ear affected him\\nnot at all; he never paused for an answer, and, in any case, was far too\\ngood-natured to care if he received none.\\n\\nBy the time they had duly inspected the mare and walked back to the\\nhouse, it was nearly four o\\'clock, and, not altogether to Carstares\\'\\nsurprise, Lavinia was awaiting them on the terrace, clad in a totally\\ndifferent gown, and with her hair freshly arranged and curled.\\n\\n\"\\'Twould appear that Lavinia has recovered,\" remarked Andrew as they\\nmounted the steps. \"She was ever thus--not two minutes the same. Well,\\nLavvy?\"\\n\\n\"Well, Andrew?\" She gave him a careless hand to kiss, but smiled sweetly\\nup at her husband. \"My headache is so much better,\" she told him, \"and\\nthey said that Andrew was come to see you. So I came downstairs.\" She\\nturned eagerly to her brother. \"Tell me, Andrew, is Tracy at home?\"\\n\\n\"Lord, yes! He arrived yesterday, devil take him! Do you want him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes,\" she nodded. \"I want to see him again. I\\'ve not set eyes on\\nhim for an age. I want you to take me back with you.\"\\n\\n\"Surely, my dear, \\'tis a trifle late in the day for such a drive?\"\\ndemurred Richard, trying to conceal his annoyance. \"Can you not wait\\nuntil to-morrow?\"\\n\\n\"Faith, you\\'ll have to, Lavvy, for I\\'ll not take you to-day, that\\'s\\ncertain. I\\'m riding to Fletcher\\'s when I leave here. Tracy can visit you\\nto-morrow an he chooses.\"\\n\\n\"Will he?\" she asked doubtfully.\\n\\nAndrew clapped his hand to his vest pocket. \"If I had not forgot!\" he\\nexclaimed. \"I\\'ve a letter from him for you. He intends waiting on you\\nto-morrow, in any case. Lord, what it is to have a scatter brain like\\nmine!\" He pulled a handful of papers from his pocket and selected one,\\nsealed, and addressed in a sloping Italian handwriting.\\n\\nLavinia pounced upon it joyfully, and tore it open. Andrew restored the\\nrest of the documents to his pocket with yet another rueful laugh.\\n\\n\"Duns, Richard! Duns!\"\\n\\n\"Give them to me,\" answered the other, holding out his hand.\\n\\n\"Oh, no! But many thanks, Dick. These are quite unimportant.\"\\n\\n\"Why not pay them all, and start afresh?\" urged Carstares.\\n\\n\"Lord, no! Why, I should be so damned elated that before the day was out\\nthere\\'d be a score of fresh debts staring me in the face!\"\\n\\n\"Let me lend you a thousand to begin on? Could you not keep out of\\ndebt?\"\\n\\n\"I keep out of debt? Impossible! Don\\'t look so solemn, Dick; I told you\\n\\'twas in the blood. We never have a penny to bless ourselves with, but\\nwhat\\'s the odds? I shall have a run of luck soon--a man can\\'t always\\nlose. Then I shall be able to repay you, but, of course, I shan\\'t.\\nIt\\'ll all go at the next table. _I_ know!\" He spoke so ingenuously that\\nRichard could not be angry with him. There was a certain frankness about\\nhim that pleased, and though he might be spendthrift and heedless, and\\ncolossally selfish, Richard felt a genuine affection for him. He would\\nhave liked to argue the point further, but Lavinia came forward,\\nrefolding her letter.\\n\\n\"Tracy is coming to-morrow afternoon,\" she told her husband. \"\\'Twill be\\nprodigiously agreeable, will it not?\"\\n\\nHe assented, but with a lack of warmth that did not fail to strike her\\nears.\\n\\n\"And he will stay to dine with us!\" she cried challengingly.\\n\\n\"Certainly, my love.\"\\n\\n\"Look pleased, Dicky, look pleased! Why don\\'t you like Tracy? He is my\\nown brother; you _must_ like him!\"\\n\\n\"Of course I like him, Lavinia. Pray, do not be foolish.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I am not! Don\\'t be cross, Dicky dear!\"\\n\\n\"Well, if you like him, I\\'m surprised,\" broke in Andrew. \"I can\\'t bear\\nhim! Ay, flash your eyes at me, Lavvy; I don\\'t mind.\"\\n\\nLavinia opened her mouth to retaliate, but Richard hastily interposed.\\nTheir bickering was more than he could bear, and he never understood how\\nLavinia could stoop to quarrel with the boisterous youth, who tried so\\npalpably to rouse her.\\n\\nHe bore them both off to the house, feeling much like a nursemaid with\\ntwo recalcitrant children.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nHIS GRACE OF ANDOVER\\n\\n\\nLady Lavinia dressed herself with even more than her usual care next\\nafternoon, and well-nigh drove her maid distracted by her flashes of\\ntemper and impatient, contradictory orders. So lengthy was the toilet\\nthat she was only just in her boudoir when his Grace of Andover was\\nannounced. She had no time to tell the footman that she would receive\\nhis Grace, for almost before the words were out of James\\' mouth, he\\nstood bowing in the doorway, sure of his welcome.\\n\\nHe was curiously like his sister, this man, and at the same time\\ncuriously unlike. Hers were the high cheek-bones and pinched,\\naristocratic nostrils, but the mouth with its thin lips, and the\\nheavy-lidded green eyes, were totally different. His Grace\\'s brows\\nslanted up at the corners, and his eyes, though piercing and bright,\\nwere constantly veiled by the black-lashed lids. He wore his own black\\nhair, unpowdered, and that, together with the black and silver garments\\nthat he always affected, greatly enhanced the natural pallor of his\\ncountenance. Altogether it was a very striking figure that stood just\\nbefore the closed white door and bowed to my lady.\\n\\nLavinia took an eager step towards him, swinging her pearl-grey\\nbrocades.\\n\\n\"Oh, Tracy!\" she cooed, holding out both hands.\\n\\nHis Grace advanced into the room and bent low over them.\\n\\n\"I rejoice to find you within, Lavinia,\" he said, a faint tinge of\\nsarcasm running through his smooth tones. \"As you perceive, I rode\\nover.\" He made a gesture towards his high boots with their\\nwicked-looking spurs. \"No doubt Andrew forgot to give you my letter?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" she said, slipping her hand in his arm. \"He remembered in time,\\nand--oh, Tracy, I was so vastly delighted to have it!\"\\n\\n\"I am indeed honoured,\" he replied. \"I am come on a sufficiently\\nimportant matter.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" She pulled her hand away disappointedly. \"Money!\"\\n\\n\"You are really wonderful, my dear. As you so crudely remark--money!\\nWill you not be seated?\"\\n\\nShe sank down on the couch dejectedly and watched him take a chair\\nopposite her.\\n\\n\"Your most noble lord and master lent me a trifling sum the other day,\\nbut very trifling. I am, as usual, hard-pressed. And that young fool\\nAndrew must needs fall into debt.\"\\n\\nMy lady opened wide her eyes in surprise.\\n\\n\"Do you tell me you need money from Richard to pay Andrew\\'s debts?\" she\\nasked, frankly incredulous.\\n\\n\"I do not. Is it likely? The remark was purely by the way.\"\\n\\n\"Well, in any case, Andrew borrowed three thousand from poor Dick only\\nyesterday. I know, because I heard him speak of it.\"\\n\\nHis Grace raised his black brows in patient exasperation.\\n\\n\"How unnecessary of Andrew! And how typical! So \\'poor Dick\\' has been\\nsqueezed already?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t speak like that, Tracy!\" she cried. \"Dicky is good to me!\" She\\nmet his piercing look unflinchingly.\\n\\n\"Now this becomes interesting,\" drawled the Duke. \"Since when have you\\ncome to that conclusion? And why this sudden loyalty?\"\\n\\n\"I have _always_ been loyal to him, Tracy! You know I have! I worry\\nhim--and indeed he is very forbearing.\"\\n\\n\"But how charming of him!\"\\n\\n\"No, do not sneer, Tracy! He has promised to take me to London for the\\nwhole winter--\"\\n\\nHis Grace leant back in his chair again.\\n\\n\"Now I understand,\" he said placidly. \"I was at a loss before.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis not that, Tracy! Indeed I realise how kind he is to me. And we\\nhave quarrelled again. We are always quarrelling, and I know \\'tis all my\\nfault.\"\\n\\n\"What a comfortable conviction, my dear!\"\\n\\n\"No, no! \\'Tis not comfortable, Tracy! For somehow I cannot change my\\ndisposition, though I _mean_ to be patient and sweet. Tracy, I hate\\nWyncham!\"\\n\\n\"You hate Wyncham? There was a time--\"\\n\\n\"I know, I know! But I never meant to live here always like this! I want\\nto go to London!\"\\n\\n\"I thought you said you were going?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I am! But I want to go with someone who is gay-not--not--\"\\n\\n\"In fact, you want distraction, and not with the amiable Richard? Well,\\nI can conceive that life with him might prove uninspiring. Safe, my\\ndear, but not exciting.\"\\n\\n\"I knew you would understand! You see, he does not like me to play at\\ncards, because I cannot stop! And he cannot see how \\'tis that I care\\nnought for what he calls \\'home-life\\' when there are routs, and the play,\\nand _real_ life. He--he is so--so--so _staid,_ Tracy, and careful!\"\\n\\n\"A good trait in a husband, Lavinia,\" replied his Grace cynically. \"\\'Tis\\nbecause I do not possess it that I am single now.\"\\n\\nHer lips curled scornfully at this, for well she knew her brother.\\n\\n\"No, Tracy, that is not so! It is because you are a devil! No woman\\nwould marry you!\"\\n\\n\"That is most interesting, my dear,\" purred his Grace. \"But pray strive\\nto be a little more original. Continue your analysis of Richard\\'s\\nsterling character.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis only that we are so different,\" she sighed. \"I always desire to do\\nthings quickly--if I think of something, I want it at once--at once! You\\nknow, Tracy! And he likes to wait and think on it, and--oh, \\'tis so\\ntiresome, and it puts me in a bad humour, and I behave like a hysterical\\nbourgeoise!\" She got up swiftly, clasping her nervous little hands.\\n\"When he speaks to me in that gentle, reasoning way, I could scream,\\nTracy! Do you think I am mad?\" She laughed unmusically.\\n\\n\"No,\" he replied, \"but the next thing to it: a Belmanoir. Perhaps it was\\na pity you ever married Richard. But there is always the money.\"\\n\\n\"There is not,\" she cried out sharply.\\n\\n\"Not? What mean you?\"\\n\\n\"Tracy, \\'tis of this that I wanted to speak! You think my lord left his\\nmoney to Dick?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. He should be stupendously wealthy.\"\\n\\n\"He is not!\"\\n\\n\"But, my good girl, the revenue must be enormous. He has the land,\\nsurely?\"\\n\\n\"No! No! He has not the land! Oh, but I am angry whenever I think on it!\\nHe induced my lord to leave it to John. _He_ has but his younger son\\'s\\nportion!\"\\n\\n\"I still fail to understand. You informed me that the Earl left all to\\nRichard?\"\\n\\n\"He changed his will, Tracy!\"\\n\\n\"He--changed--his--will! Then, my dear, must you have played your cards\\nvery badly!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twas not my fault, Tracy--indeed \\'twas not! I knew nought until the\\nwill was read. Richard never spoke a word to me about it! And now we are\\ncomparatively poor!\" Her voice trembled with indignation, but his Grace\\nonly whistled beneath his breath.\\n\\n\"I always knew, of course, that Dick was a fool, but I never guessed how\\nmuch so till now!\"\\n\\nAt that she flared up.\\n\\n\"He is not a fool! He is an honest man, and \\'tis we_--we_, I tell\\nyou--who are mean and despicable and mercenary!\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly, Lavinia, but pray do not excite yourself over it. I\\nsuppose he is still devoted to that young hothead?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes--\\'tis all Jack, Jack, Jack, until I am sick to death of the\\nsound of his name--and--\" She broke off, biting her lip.\\n\\n\"And what?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, nought! But \\'tis all so disagreeable, Tracy!\"\\n\\n\"It certainly is slightly disturbing. You had better have chosen John,\\nin spite of all, it seems.\"\\n\\nShe stamped angrily.\\n\\n\"Oh, where\\'s the good in being flippant?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Lavinia, where\\'s the good in being anything else? The situation\\nstrikes me as rather amusing. To think of the worthy Richard so neatly\\noverturning all my plans!\"\\n\\n\"If it had not been for you, I might never have married him. Why did you\\nthrow them both in my way? Why did I ever set eyes on either?\"\\n\\n\"It should have been a good match, my dear, and, if I remember rightly,\\nno one was more alive to that fact than yourself.\"\\n\\nShe pouted angrily and turned her shoulder to him.\\n\\n\"Still,\" he continued reflectively, \"I admit that for the smart lot we\\nare, we do seem rather to have bungled the affair.\"\\n\\nLavinia swept round upon him.\\n\\n\"Oh, do you care no more than that? How can you be so casual! Does it\\naffect you not at all?\"\\n\\nHe wrinkled his thin nose expressively.\\n\\n\"I shall not weep over it, Lavinia, but \\'tis a plaguey nuisance. But we\\nmust see what can be done. And that brings me back to the original\\nsubject. Despite these upsetting revelations, I still require that\\nmoney.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear! How much must you have, Tracy?\"\\n\\n\"Five hundred might suffice.\"\\n\\n\"Tracy, do not the estates bring in anything?\" she asked petulantly.\\n\"And Andrew told us you had a run of marvellous luck not a fortnight\\nsince?\"\\n\\n\"Since then, my dear, I have had three runs of marvellous ill-luck. As\\nto the estates, they are mortgaged up to the hilt, as you very well\\nknow. What little there is is between three. And Robert is extravagant.\"\\n\\n\"I hate Robert!\"\\n\\n\"I am not partial to him myself, but it makes no odds.\"\\n\\n\"I wish he might die!--oh no, no! Now I am become ill-natured again--I\\ndon\\'t wish it--only I am so tired of everything. You shall have that\\nmoney as soon as possible; but be careful, Tracy--please be careful!\\n\\'Tis not easy to get money from Dick!\"\\n\\n\"No, I should imagine not. However, we have managed rather well up to\\nthe present, take it all in all.\"\\n\\n\"Up to the present he has had all the money he wanted. My lord denied\\nhim nought!\"\\n\\n\"Well, \\'tis unfortunate, as I said before, but it must be endured. Where\\nis Dick?\"\\n\\n\"I know not. You will stay to dinner, Tracy?\"\\n\\n\"Thank you. I shall be charmed.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes--oh, how prodigiously pleasant it is to see you again! Soon I\\nshall come to Andover. Will you let me stay a few days?\"\\n\\n\"The question is, will Richard allow you to stay so long in my\\ncontaminating presence?\"\\n\\n\"Richard would never keep me away, Tracy!\" she replied proudly. \"He\\n_could_ not. Oh, why is it that I don\\'t love him more? Why do I not care\\nfor him as much as I care for you even?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Lavinia, like all Belmanoirs, you care first for yourself and\\nsecondly for the man who masters you. That, alas! Richard has not yet\\nsucceeded in doing.\"\\n\\n\"But I _do_ love Richard. I do, I do, yet--\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. \\'Yet!\\' The \\'grand passion\\' has not yet touched you, my dear,\\nand you are quite self-absorbed.\"\\n\\n\"Self-absorbed! Those are hard words.\"\\n\\n\"But not too hard for the case. You think solely of yourself, your own\\npleasure, your own character, your own feelings. If you could cast\\nyourself into the background a little, you would be less excitable and\\nconsiderably less discontented.\"\\n\\n\"How dare you, Tracy! Pray, what of you? Are you so selfless?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all. I am precisely the same. I was merely suggesting that you\\nmight be happier an you could depose \\'self.\\'\"\\n\\n\"You had best do the same yourself!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Lavinia, when I feel the need of greater happiness, I most\\nundoubtedly shall. At present I am quite content.\"\\n\\n\"You are unkind!\" she protested. \"And you sneer at me.\"\\n\\n\"Pray, accept my heartfelt apologies! You shall come to Andover if the\\nworthy Richard permits.\"\\n\\nHer face cleared as by magic.\\n\\n\"Oh, Tracy! Oh, I am so desirous to be gay once more! I cannot even\\nreceive now, on account of this mourning! But when I am at Andover--oh,\\nwe will not worry over anything, and I can be bad-tempered without\\nfeeling that someone is being hurt by me! Oh, come to Dicky at once--at\\nonce!\"\\n\\nHe rose leisurely.\\n\\n\"I can imagine that you try Richard\\'s patience somewhat,\" he remarked.\\n\"Happily, your impetuosity in no way disturbs me. We will go in search\\nof Richard.\"\\n\\nHalf-way down the great staircase she perceived her husband, and flew to\\nmeet him.\\n\\n\"Richard, I was coming in search of you! Tracy has invited me to Andover\\nfor a week--he purposes to ask several people to stay, and there will be\\nparties--and entertainment! You will let me go? Say yes, Dicky--say yes,\\nquickly!\"\\n\\nCarstares bowed to his Grace, who stood watching them from the stairs.\\nThe bow was returned with exaggerated flourish. Carstares looked down at\\nhis wife.\\n\\n\"So soon, Lavinia?\" he remonstrated, and indicated her mourning. She\\nshook his hand off impatiently.\\n\\n\"Oh, Dicky, does it matter? What can it signify? I do not ask you to\\ncome--\"\\n\\n\"No,\" he said half-sadly, half-amusedly. \"I notice that, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"No, no! I did not mean to be unkind--you must not think that! You\\n_don\\'t_ think it, do you, Dick?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no,\" he sighed.\\n\\n\"Good Dicky!\" She patted his cheek coaxingly. \"Then you will allow me to\\ngo--ah, but yes, yes, you must listen! You know how dull I am, and how\\nsilly--\\'tis because I need a change, and I _want_ to go to Andover. I\\n_want_ to go!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, dear, I know. But my father is not yet dead six weeks, and I\\ncannot think it seemly--\"\\n\\n\"Please, Dick, please! Please do not say no! \\'Twill make me so unhappy!\\nOh, you will not be so unkind? You will not forbid me to go?\"\\n\\n\"I ask you not to, Lavinia. If you need a change, I will take you\\nquietly to Bath, or where you will. Do not pain me by going to Andover\\njust now.\"\\n\\n\"Bath! Bath! What do I want with Bath at this time of the year? Oh, \\'tis\\nkind in you to offer, but I want to go to Andover! I want to see all the\\nold friends again. And I want to get away from everything here--\\'tis all\\nso gloomy--after--after my lord\\'s death!\"\\n\\n\"Dearest, of course you shall go away--but if only you would remember\\nthat you are in mourning--\"\\n\\n\"But \\'tis what I wish to forget! Oh, Dicky, don\\'t, don\\'t, don\\'t be\\nunkind.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, dear. If you must go--go.\"\\n\\nShe clapped her hands joyfully.\\n\\n\"Oh thank you, Dicky! And you are not angry with me?\"\\n\\n\"No, dear, of course not.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! Now I am happy! \\'Tis sweet of you, Dicky, but confess you are\\nsecretly thankful to be rid of me for a week! Now are you not?\" She\\nspread out her fan in the highest good-humour and coquetted behind it.\\nRichard was induced to smile.\\n\\n\"I fear I shall miss you too sadly, dear.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" She dropped the fan. \"But think how you will look forward to\\nseeing me again, and I you. Why, I shall be so thankful to be back after\\na week away, that I shall be good for months!\"\\n\\nHis face lightened, and he caught her hands in his.\\n\\n\"Darling, if I thought you would miss me--\"\\n\\n\"But of course I shall miss you, Dick--oh, _pray_, mind my frock! Shall\\nI not miss him, Tracy?\"\\n\\nRichard suddenly remembered his brother-in-law\\'s presence. He turned and\\nwent to the foot of the stairs.\\n\\n\"So you are determined to wrest my wife from me?\" he smiled.\\n\\nTracy descended leisurely, opening his snuff-box.\\n\\n\"Yes, I require a hostess,\" he said. \"And I have\"--he paused--\"induced\\nher to honour Andover with her presence. Shall we have the felicity of\\nseeing you at any time?\"\\n\\n\"I thank you, no. I am not, you will understand, in the mood for the\\ngaiety for which my poor Lavinia craves.\"\\n\\nThe Duke bowed slightly, and they all three went out on to the terrace,\\nLavinia laughing and talking as Richard had not heard her laugh or talk\\nfor days. She was the life and soul of the little dinner-party, flirting\\nprettily with her husband and exerting herself to please him in every\\nway. She had won her point; therefore she was in excellent spirits with\\nall the world, and not even the spilling of some wine on her new silk\\nserved to discompose her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\nBATH: 29 QUEEN SQUARE\\n\\n\\nThe autumn and the winter passed smoothly, and April found the Carstares\\ninstalled at Bath, whither Lady Lavinia had teased her husband into\\ngoing, despite his desire to return to Wyncham and John. She herself did\\nnot care to be with the child, and was perfectly content that Richard\\nshould journey occasionally to Wyncham to see that all was well with\\nhim.\\n\\nOn the whole, she had enjoyed the winter, for she had induced Richard to\\nopen Wyncham House, Mayfair, the Earl\\'s town residence, where she had\\nbeen able to hold several entirely successful routs, and many select\\nlittle card-parties. Admirers she had a-many, and nothing so pleased her\\nvain little heart as masculine adulation. Carstares never entered his\\nhome without stumbling against some fresh flame of hers, but as they\\nmostly consisted of what he rudely termed the lap-dog type, he was\\nconscious of no jealous qualms, and patiently submitted to their\\ninundation of his house. He was satisfied that Lavinia was happy, and,\\nas he assured himself at times when he was most tried, nothing else\\nsignified.\\n\\nThe only flaw to Lavinia\\'s content was the need of money. Not that she\\nwas stinted, or ever refused anything that he could in reason give her;\\nbut her wants were never reasonable. She would demand a new town\\nchariot, upholstered in pale blue, not because her own was worn or\\nshabby, but because she was tired of its crimson cushions. Or she would\\nsuddenly take a fancy to some new, and usually fabulously expensive toy,\\nand having acquired it, weary of it in a week.\\n\\nWithout a murmur, Richard gave her lap-dogs (of the real kind), black\\npages, jewels, and innumerable kickshaws, for which she rewarded him\\nwith her brightest smiles and tenderest caresses. But when she required\\nhim to refurnish Wyncham House in the style of the French Court,\\nthrowing away all the present Queen Anne furniture, the tapestries, and\\nthe countless old trappings that were one and all so beautiful and so\\nvaluable, he put his foot down with a firmness that surprised her. Not\\nfor any whim of hers was Jack\\'s house to be spoiled. Neither her coaxing\\nnor her tears had any effect upon Richard, and when she reverted to\\nsulks, he scolded her so harshly that she was frightened, and in\\nconsequence silenced.\\n\\nFor a week she thought and dreamt of nothing but gilded French chairs,\\nand then abruptly, as all else, the fancy left her, and she forgot all\\nabout it. Her mantua-maker\\'s bills were enormous, and caused Richard\\nmany a sleepless night, but she was always so charmingly penitent that\\nhe could not find it in his heart to be angry; and, after all, he\\nreflected, he would rather have his money squandered on her adornment\\nthan on that of her brothers. She was by turns passionate and cold to\\nhim: one day enrapturing him by some pretty blandishment, the next\\nsnapping peevishly when he spoke to her.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the season he dutifully conducted her to routs and\\n_bals masqués_, but soon she began to go always with either Andrew or\\nRobert, both of whom were in town, and whose casual chaperonage she much\\npreferred to Richard\\'s solicitous care. Tracy was rarely in London for\\nmore than a few days at a time, and the Carstares, greatly to Richard\\'s\\nrelief, saw but little of him. Carstares disliked Colonel Lord Robert\\nBelmanoir, but the Duke he detested, not only for his habitual sneer\\ntowards him, but for the influence that he undoubtedly held over\\nLavinia. Richard was intensely jealous of this, and could sometimes\\nhardly bring himself to be civil when his Grace visited my lady. Whether\\njustly or not, he inwardly blamed Tracy for all Lavinia\\'s crazy whims\\nand periodical fits of ill-temper. It did not take his astute Grace long\\nto discover this, and with amused devilry he played upon it, encouraging\\nLavinia in her extravagance, and making a point of calling on her\\nwhenever he was in town.\\n\\nCarstares never knew when not to expect to find him there; he came and\\nwent to and from London with no warning whatsoever. No one ever knew\\nwhere he was for more than a day at a time, and no one was in the least\\nsurprised if he happened to be seen in London when he should, according\\nto all accounts, have been in Paris. They merely shrugged their\\nshoulders, and exchanged glances, murmuring: \"Devil Belmanoir!\" and\\nwondering what fresh intrigue he was in.\\n\\nSo altogether Richard was not sorry when my lady grew suddenly sick of\\ntown and was seized with a longing for Bath. He had secretly hoped that\\nshe might return to Wyncham, but when she expressed no such wish, he\\nstifled his own longing for home, shut up the London house, and took her\\nand all her baggage to Bath, installing her in Queen Square in one of\\nthe most elegantly furnished houses in the place.\\n\\nLady Lavinia was at first charmed to be there again; delighted with the\\nhouse, and transported over the excellencies of the new French milliner\\nshe had discovered.\\n\\nBut the milliner\\'s bills proved monstrous, and the drawing-room of her\\nhouse not large enough for the routs she contemplated giving. The air\\nwas too relaxing for her, and she was subject to constant attacks of the\\nvapours that were as distressing to her household as they were to\\nherself. The late hours made her head ache as it never ached in London,\\nand the damp gave her a cold. Furthermore, the advent of an attractive\\nand exceedingly wealthy little widow caused her many a bitter hour, to\\nthe considerable detriment of her good-temper.\\n\\nShe was lying on a couch in her white and gilt drawing room one\\nafternoon--alas! the craze for French furniture was o\\'er-smelling-bottle\\nin hand and a _bona fide_ ache in her head, when the door opened and\\nTracy walked into the room.\\n\\n\"Good heavens!\" she said faintly, and uncorked her salts.\\n\\nIt was his Grace\\'s first appearance since she had come to Bath, and the\\nfact that he had politely declined an invitation that she had sent to\\nhim still rankled in her mind. He bowed over the limp hand that she\\nextended, and looked her up and down.\\n\\n\"I regret to find you thus indisposed, my dear sister,\" he said\\nsmoothly.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis nought. Only one of my stupid headaches. I am never well here, and\\nthis house is stuffy,\" she answered fretfully.\\n\\n\"You should take the waters,\" he said, scrutinising, through his\\neyeglass, the chair to which she had waved him. \"It has an unstable\\nappearance, my dear; I believe I prefer the couch.\" He moved to a\\nsmaller sofa and sat down.\\n\\n\"Pray, how long have you been in Bath?\" she demanded.\\n\\n\"I arrived last Tuesday week.\"\\n\\nLady Lavinia started up.\\n\\n\"Last Tuesday week? Then you have been here ten days and not visited me\\nuntil now!\"\\n\\nHe appeared to be examining the whiteness of his hands through the folds\\nof black lace that drooped over them.\\n\\n\"I believe I had other things to do,\" he said coolly.\\n\\nA book of sermons that she had been trying to peruse slid to the ground\\nas Lavinia jerked a cushion into place.\\n\\n\"And you come to me when it suits you? How could you be so unkind as to\\nrefuse my invitation?\"\\n\\nThere was a rising, querulous note in her voice which gave warning of\\nanger.\\n\\n\"My dear Lavinia, if you exhibit your deplorable temper to me, I shall\\nleave you, so have a care. I thought you would understand that your good\\nhusband\\'s society, improving though it may be, would be altogether too\\noppressive for my taste. In fact, I was surprised at your letter.\"\\n\\n\"You might have come for my sake,\" she answered peevishly, sinking back\\nagain. \"I suppose you have been dancing attendance on the Molesly woman?\\nLud! but I think you men have gone crazed.\"\\n\\nUnderstanding came to his Grace, and he smiled provokingly.\\n\\n\"Is that what upsets you? I wondered.\"\\n\\n\"No, \\'tis not!\" she flashed. \"And I do not see why you should think so!\\nFor my part, I cannot see that she is even tolerable, and the way the\\nmen rave about her is disgusting! Disgusting! But \\'tis always the same\\nwhen a woman is unattached and wealthy. Well! Well! Why do you not say\\nsomething? Do you find her so lovely?\"\\n\\n\"To tell the truth, my dear, I have barely set eyes on the lady. I have\\nbeen otherwise engaged, and I have done with all women, for the time,\\nsave one.\"\\n\\n\"So I have heard you say before. Do you contemplate marriage? Lud! but I\\npity the girl.\" She gave a jeering little laugh, but it was evident that\\nshe was interested.\\n\\nHis Grace was not in the least degree ruffled.\\n\\n\"I do not contemplate marriage, Lavinia, so your sympathies are wasted.\\nI have met a girl--a mere child, for sure--and I will not rest until I\\nhave her.\"\\n\\n\"Lord! Another farmer\\'s chit?\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear sister, not another farmer\\'s chit. A lady.\"\\n\\n\"God help her! Who is she? Where does she live?\"\\n\\n\"She lives in Sussex. Her name I shall not tell you.\"\\n\\nHer ladyship kicked an offending cushion on to the floor, and snapped at\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Oh, as you please! I shall not die of curiosity!\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" The cynical lips curled annoyingly, and Lady Lavinia was seized\\nwith a mad desire to hurl her smelling-bottle at him. But she knew that\\nit was worse than useless to be angry with Tracy, so she yawned\\nostentatiously, and hoped that she irritated him. If she did, she got no\\nsatisfaction from it, for he continued, quite imperturbably:\\n\\n\"She is the daintiest piece ever a man saw, and I\\'ll swear there\\'s blood\\nand fire beneath the ice!\"\\n\\n\"Is it possible the girl will have none of your Grace?\" wondered Lavinia\\nin mock amazement, and had the pleasure of seeing him frown.\\n\\nThe thin brows met over his arched nose, and the eyes glinted a little,\\nwhile she caught a glimpse of cruel white teeth closing on a sensual\\nunder-lip. She watched his hand clench on his snuff-box, and exulted\\nsilently at having roused him. It was a very brief joy, however, for the\\nnext moment the frown had disappeared, the hand unclenched, and he was\\nsmiling again.\\n\\n\"At present she is cold,\" he admitted, \"but I hope that in time she will\\nbecome more plastic. I think, Lavinia, I have some experience with your\\ncharming, if capricious sex.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t doubt you have. Where did you meet this perverse beauty?\"\\n\\n\"In the Pump Room.\"\\n\\n\"Lud! Pray, describe her.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be delighted. She is taller than yourself, and dark. Her hair\\nis like a dusky cloud of black, and it ripples off her brow and over her\\nlittle ears in a most damnably alluring fashion. Her eyes are brown, but\\nthere are lights in them that are purest amber, and yet they are dark\\nand velvety--\"\\n\\nMy lady had recourse to the smelling-bottle.\\n\\n\"But I perceive I weary you. A man in love, my dear Lavinia--\"\\n\\nShe was up again at that.\\n\\n\"In love? You? Nonsense! Nonsense! Nonsense! You do not know what the\\nword means. You are like a--like a fish, with no more of love in you\\nthan a fish, and no more heart than a fish, and--\"\\n\\n\"Spare me the rest, I beg. I am very clammy, I make no doubt, but you\\nwill at least accord me more brain than a fish?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you have brain enough!\" she raged. \"Brain for evil! I grant you\\nthat!\"\\n\\n\"It is really very kind of you--\"\\n\\n\"The passion you feel now is not _love_. It is--it is--\"\\n\\n\"Your pardon, my dear, but at the present moment I am singularly devoid\\nof all strenuous emotions, so your remark is--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Tracy, Tracy, I am even quarrelling with you!\" she cried\\nwretchedly. \"Oh, why?--why?\"\\n\\n\"You are entirely mistaken, my dear. This is but the interchange of\\ncompliments. Pray, do not let me hinder you in the contribution of your\\nshare!\"\\n\\nHer lip trembled.\\n\\n\"Go on, Tracy, go on.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. I had described her eyes, I think?\"\\n\\n\"Very tediously.\"\\n\\n\"I will strive to be brief. Her lips are the most kissable that I have\\never seen--\"\\n\\n\"And, as you remarked, you have experience,\" she murmured. He bowed\\nironically.\\n\\n\"Altogether she\\'s as spirited a filly as you could wish for. All she\\nneeds is bringing to heel.\"\\n\\n\"Does one bring a filly to heel? I rather thought--\"\\n\\n\"As usual, my dear Lavinia, you are right: one does not. One breaks in a\\nfilly. I beg leave to thank you for correcting my mixed metaphor.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, pray do not mention it.\"\\n\\n\"I will cease to do so. She needs breaking in. It should be amusing to\\ntame her.\"\\n\\n\"Should it?\" She looked curiously at him.\\n\\n\"Vastly. And I am persuaded it can be done. I will have her.\"\\n\\n\"But what if she\\'ll none of you?\"\\n\\nSuddenly the heavy lids were raised.\\n\\n\"She will have no choice.\"\\n\\nLady Lavinia shivered and sat up.\\n\\n\"La, Tracy! Will you have no sense of decency?\" she cried. \"I suppose,\"\\nshe sneered, \"you think to kidnap the girl?\"\\n\\n\"Exactly,\" he nodded.\\n\\nShe gasped at the effrontery of it.\\n\\n\"Heavens, are you mad? Kidnap a lady! This is no peasant girl, remember.\\nTracy, Tracy, pray do not be foolish! How _can_ you kidnap her?\"\\n\\n\"That, my dear, is a point which I have not yet decided. But I do not\\nanticipate much trouble.\"\\n\\n\"But goodness gracious me! has the child no protectors? No brothers? No\\nfather?\"\\n\\n\"There is a father,\" said Tracy slowly. \"He was here at the beginning of\\ntheir stay. He does not signify, and, which is important, he is of those\\nthat truckle. Were _I_ to make myself known to him, I believe I might\\nmarry the girl within an hour. But I do not want that. At least--not\\nyet.\"\\n\\n\"Good God, Tracy! do you think you are living in the Dark Ages? One\\ncannot do these things now, I tell you! Will you not at least remember\\nthat you represent our house? \\'Twill be a pretty thing an there is a\\nscandal!\" She broke off hopelessly and watched him flick a remnant of\\nsnuff from his cravat.\\n\\n\"Oh, Tracy! \\'Tis indeed a dangerous game you play. Pray consider!\"\\n\\n\"Really, Lavinia, you are most entertaining. I trust I am capable of\\ncaring for myself and mine own honour.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t sneer--don\\'t sneer!\" she cried. \"Sometimes I think I quite\\nhate you!\"\\n\\n\"You would be the more amusing, my dear.\"\\n\\nShe swept the back of her hand across her eyes in a characteristic\\nmovement.\\n\\n\"How cross I am!\" she said, and laughed waveringly. \"You must bear with\\nme, Tracy. Indeed, I am not well.\"\\n\\n\"You should take the waters,\" he repeated.\\n\\n\"Oh, I do!--I do! And that reminds me that I must look for your beauty.\"\\n\\n\"She is not like to be there,\" he answered. \"\\'Tis only very seldom that\\nshe appears.\"\\n\\n\"What! Is she then _religieuse_?\"\\n\\n\"_Religieuse_! Why, in heaven\\'s name?\"\\n\\n\"But not to walk in the Rooms--!\"\\n\\n\"She is staying here with her aunt, who has been ill. They do not mix\\nmuch in society.\"\\n\\n\"How very dreadful! Yet she used to walk in the Rooms, for you met her\\nthere?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he admitted coolly. \"\\'Tis for that reason that she now avoids\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Tracy, the poor child!\" exclaimed his sister in a sudden fit of\\npity. \"How can you persecute her, if she dislikes you?\"\\n\\n\"She does not.\"\\n\\n\"Not! Then--\"\\n\\n\"Rather, she fears me. But she is intrigued, for all that. I persecute\\nher, as you call it, for her own (and my) ultimate good. But they quit\\nBath in a few days, and then, _nous verrons_!\" He rose. \"What of Honest\\nDick?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t call him by that odious name! I will not have it!\"\\n\\n\"Odious, my dear? Odious? You would have reason an I called him\\n_Dis_honest Dick.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t! Don\\'t!\" she cried, covering her ears. His Grace laughed softly.\\n\\n\"Oh, Lavinia, you must get the better of these megrims of yours, for\\nthere is nought that sickens a man sooner, believe me.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, go away!--go away!\" she implored. \"You tease me and tease me until\\nI cannot bear it, and indeed I do not _mean_ to be shrewish! Please go!\"\\n\\n\"I am on the point of doing so, my dear. I trust you will have in a\\nmeasure recovered when next I see you. Pray bear my respects to Hon--to\\nthe Honourable Richard.\"\\n\\nShe stretched out her hand.\\n\\n\"Come again soon!\" she begged. \"I shall be better to-morrow! \\'Tis only\\nto-day that my head aches till I could shriek with the worry and the\\npain of it! Come again!\"\\n\\n\"Unfortunately I anticipate leaving Bath within a day or two. But\\nnothing would have given me greater pleasure than to comply with your\\nwishes.\" He kissed her hand punctiliously, and took his leave. At the\\ndoor he paused, and looked back mockingly. \"By the way--her name\\nis--Diana.\" He bowed again and swept out, as Lavinia buried her face in\\nthe cushions and burst into tears.\\n\\nIt was thus that Richard found her, twenty minutes later, and his\\nconcern was so great that it in part restored her spirits, and she spent\\na quiet and, for him, blissful evening, playing at piquet.\\n\\nIn the middle of a game she suddenly flung down her hand and caught at\\nhis wrist.\\n\\n\"Dicky, Dicky--I will go home!\"\\n\\n\"Go home? What do you mean? Not--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes--Wyncham! Why not?\"\\n\\n\"My dear, do you mean it?\" His voice quivered with joyful surprise, and\\nthe cards slipped from his hands.\\n\\n\"Yes, I mean it! But take me quickly before I change my mind! I can\\nsleep at Wyncham, and here I lie awake all night, and my head aches.\\nTake me home and I will try to be a better wife! Oh, Dicky, have I been\\ntiresome and exacting? I did not mean to be! Why do you let me?\" She\\ncame quickly round the table and knelt at his side, giving no heed to\\nthe crumpling of her billowing silks. \"I have been a wicked, selfish\\nwoman!\" she said vehemently. \"But indeed I will be better. You must not\\n_let_ me be bad--you _must_ not, I tell you!\"\\n\\nHe flung his arm about her plump shoulders and drew her tightly to him.\\n\\n\"When I get you home at Wyncham, I promise you I will finely hector you,\\nsweetheart,\" he said, laughing to conceal his deeper feelings. \"I shall\\nmake you into a capital housewife!\"\\n\\n\"And I will learn to make butter,\" she nodded. \"Then I must wear a\\ndimity gown with a muslin apron and cap. Oh, yes, yes-a dimity gown!\"\\nShe sprang up and danced to the middle of the room. \"Shall I not be\\ncharming, Richard?\"\\n\\n\"Very charming, Lavinia!\"\\n\\n\"Of course! Oh, we will go home at once--at once! But first I must\\nprocure some new gowns from Marguerite!\"\\n\\n\"To make butter in, dear?\" he protested.\\n\\nShe was not attending.\\n\\n\"A dimity gown--or shall it be of tiffany with a quilted petticoat? Or\\nboth?\" she chanted. \"Dicky, I shall set a fashion in country toilettes!\"\\n\\nDicky sighed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\nINTRODUCING SUNDRY NEW CHARACTERS\\n\\n\\nNot twenty minutes\\' walk from Lady Lavinia\\'s house in Queen Square\\nresided a certain Madam Thompson--a widow--who had lived in Bath for\\nnearly fifteen years. With her was staying Miss Elizabeth Beauleigh and\\nher niece, Diana. Madam Thompson had been at a seminary with Miss\\nElizabeth when both were girls, and they had ever afterwards kept up\\ntheir friendship, occasionally visiting one another, but more often\\ncontenting themselves with the writing of lengthy epistles, full of\\nunimportant scraps of news and much gossip, amusing only on Miss\\nElizabeth\\'s side, and on the widow\\'s uninteresting and rambling.\\n\\nIt was a great joy to Madam Thompson when she received a letter from\\nMiss Beauleigh begging that she and her niece might be allowed to pay a\\nvisit to her house in Bath, and to stay at least three weeks. The good\\nlady was delighted at having her standing invitation at last accepted,\\nand straightway wrote back a glad assent. She prepared her very best\\nbedchamber for Miss Beauleigh, who, she understood, was coming to Bath\\nprincipally for a change of air and scene after a long and rather trying\\nillness.\\n\\nIn due course the two ladies arrived, the elder very small and thin, and\\nbirdlike in her movements; the younger moderately tall, and graceful as\\na willow tree, with great candid brown eyes that looked fearlessly out\\non to the world, and a tragic mouth that belied a usually cheerful\\ndisposition, and hinted at a tendency to look on the gloomy side of\\nlife.\\n\\nMadam Thompson, whose first meeting with Diana this was, remarked on the\\nsad mouth to Miss Elizabeth, or Betty as she was more often called, as\\nthey sat over the fire on the first night, Diana herself having retired\\nto her room.\\n\\nMiss Betty shook her head darkly and prophesied that her precious Di\\nwould one day love some man as no man in _her_ opinion deserved to be\\nloved!\\n\\n\"And she\\'ll have love badly,\" she said, clicking her knitting-needles\\nenergetically. \"_I_ know these temperamental children!\"\\n\\n\"She looks so melancholy,\" ventured the widow.\\n\\n\"Well there you are wrong!\" replied Miss Betty. \"\\'Tis the\\nsunniest-tempered child, and the sweetest-natured in the whole wide\\nworld, bless her! But I don\\'t deny that she can be miserable. Far from\\nit. Why, I\\'ve known her weep her pretty eyes out over a dead puppy even!\\nBut usually she is gay enough.\"\\n\\n\"I fear this house will be dull and stupid for her,\" said Madam Thompson\\nregretfully. \"If only my dear son George were at home to entertain\\nher--\"\\n\\n\"My love, pray do not put yourself out! I assure you Diana will not at\\nall object to a little quiet after the life she has been leading in town\\nthis winter with her friend\\'s family.\"\\n\\nWhatever Diana thought of the quiet, she at least made no complaint, and\\nadapted herself to her surroundings quite contentedly.\\n\\nIn the morning they would all walk as far as the Assembly Rooms, and\\nMiss Betty would drink the waters in the old Pump Room, pacing sedately\\nup and down with her friend on one side and her niece on the other.\\nMadam Thompson had very few acquaintances in Bath, and the people she\\ndid know were all of her own age and habits, rarely venturing as far as\\nthe crowded fashionable quarter; so Diana had to be content with the\\nsociety of the two old ladies, who gossiped happily enough together, but\\nwhose conversation she could not but find singularly uninteresting.\\n\\nShe watched the _monde_ with concealed wistfulness, seeing Beau Nash\\nstrut about among the ladies, bowing with his extreme gallantry, always\\nimpeccably garbed, and in spite of his rapidly increasing age and bulk\\nstill absolute monarch of Bath. She saw fine painted madams in enormous\\nhoops, and with their hair so extravagantly curled and powdered that it\\nappeared quite grotesque, mincing along with their various cavaliers;\\nelderly beaux with coats padded to hid their shrunken shoulders, and\\npaint to fill the wrinkles on their faces; young rakes; stout dowagers\\nwith their demure daughters; old ladies who had come to Bath for their\\nhealth\\'s sake; titled folk of fashion, and plain gentry from the\\ncountry--all parading before her eyes.\\n\\nOne or two young bucks tried to ogle her, and received such indignant\\nglances from those clear eyes, that they never dared annoy her again,\\nbut for the most part no one paid any heed to the unknown and plainly\\nclad girl.\\n\\nThen came his Grace of Andover upon the stage.\\n\\nHe drew Diana\\'s attention from the first moment that he entered the Pump\\nRoom--a black moth amongst the gaily-hued butterflies. He had swept a\\ncomprehensive glance round the scene and at once perceived Diana.\\nSomehow, exactly how she could never afterwards remember, he had\\nintroduced himself to her aunt and won that lady\\'s good will by his\\nsmoothness of manner and polished air. Madam Thompson, who, left to\\nherself, never visited the Assembly Rooms, could not be expected to\\nrecognise Devil Belmanoir in the simple Mr. Everard who presented\\nhimself.\\n\\nAs he had told his sister, Diana was cold. There was something about his\\nGrace that repelled her, even while his mesmeric personality fascinated.\\nHe was right when he said that she feared him; she was nervous, and the\\nelement of fear gave birth to curiosity. She was intrigued, and began to\\nlook forward to his daily appearance in the Pump Room with mingled\\nexcitement and apprehension. She liked his flattering attention, and his\\ngrand air. Often she would watch him stroll across the floor, bowing to\\nright and left with that touch of insolence that characterised him, and\\nrejoiced in the knowledge that he was coming straight to her, and that\\nthe painted beauties who so palpably ogled and invited him to their\\nsides could not alter his course. She felt her power with a thrill of\\ndelight, and smiled upon Mr. Everard, giving him her hand to kiss, and\\ngraciously permitting him to sit with her beside her aunt. He would\\npoint out all the celebrities of town and Bath for her edification,\\nrecalling carefully chosen and still more carefully censured anecdotes\\nof each one. She discovered that Mr. Everard was an entertaining and\\nharmless enough companion, and even expanded a little, allowing him a\\nglimpse of her whimsical nature with its laughter and its hint of tears.\\n\\nHis Grace of Andover saw enough to guess at the unsounded depths in her\\nsoul, and he became lover-like. Diana recoiled instinctively, throwing\\nup a barrier of reserve between them. It was not what he said that\\nalarmed her, but it was the way in which he said it, and the vague\\nsomething in the purring, faintly sinister voice that she could not\\nquite define, that made her heart beat unpleasantly fast, and the blood\\nrush to her temples. She began first to dread the morning promenade,\\nand then to avoid it. One day she had a headache; the next her foot was\\nsore; another time she wanted to work at her fancy stitchery, until her\\naunt, who knew how she disliked her needle, and how singularly free from\\nheadaches and all petty ailments she was wont to be, openly taxed her\\nwith no longer wishing to walk abroad.\\n\\nThey were in the girl\\'s bedroom at the time, Diana seated before her\\ndressing-table, brushing out her hair for the night. When her aunt put\\nthe abrupt question she hesitated, caught a long strand in her comb, and\\npretended to be absorbed in its disentanglement. The clouds of rippling\\nhair half hid her face, but Miss Betty observed how her fingers\\ntrembled, and repeated her question. Then came the confession. Mr.\\nEverard was unbearable; his attentions were odious; his continued\\npresence revolting to Mistress Di. She was afraid of him, afraid of his\\ndreadful green eyes and of his soft voice. She wished they had never\\ncome to Bath, and still more that they had not met him. He looked at her\\nas if--as if--oh, in short, he was hateful!\\n\\nMiss Betty was horrified.\\n\\n\"You cannot mean it! Dear, dear, dear! Here was I thinking what a\\npleasant gentleman he was, and all the time he was persecuting my poor\\nDi, the wretch! _I_ know the type, my love, and I feel inclined to give\\nhim a good piece of my mind!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no--no!\" implored Diana. \"Indeed, you must do no such thing,\\nAuntie! He has said nought that I could possibly be offended at--\\'tis\\nbut his _manner_, and the--and the way he looked at me. Indeed, indeed,\\nyou must not!\"\\n\\n\"Tut, child! Of course I shall say nought. But it makes me so monstrous\\nangry to think of my poor lamb being tormented by such as he that I\\ndeclare I could tear his eyes out! Yes, my dear, I could! Thank goodness\\nwe are leaving Bath next week!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" sighed Diana. \"I cannot help being glad, though Madam Thompson is\\nvery amiable! \\'Tis so very different when there is no man with one!\"\\n\\n\"You are quite right, my love. We should have insisted on your father\\'s\\nstaying with us instead of allowing him to fly back to his fusty, musty\\nold volumes. I shall not be so foolish another time, I can assure you.\\nBut we need not go to the Assembly Rooms again.\"\\n\\n\"I need not go,\" corrected Diana gently. \"Of course you and Madam\\nThompson will continue to.\"\\n\\n\"To tell the truth, my love,\" confessed Miss Betty, \"I shall not be\\nsorry for an excuse to stay away. \\'Tis doubtless most ill-natured of me,\\nbut I cannot but think that Hester has altered sadly since last I saw\\nher. She is always talking of sermons and good works!\"\\n\\nDiana twisted her luxuriant hair into a long plait, and gave a gurgling\\nlittle laugh.\\n\\n\"Oh, Auntie, is it not depressing? I wondered how you could tolerate it!\\nShe is so vastly solemn, poor dear thing!\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Miss Betty charitably, \"she has seen trouble, has Hester\\nThompson, and I have my doubts about this George of hers. A worthless\\nyoung man, I fear, from all accounts. But, unkind though it may be, I\\nshall be glad to find myself at home again, and that\\'s the truth!\" She\\nrose and picked up her candle. \"In fact, I find Bath not half so amusing\\nas I was told \\'twould be.\"\\n\\nDiana walked with her to the door.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis not amusing at all when one has no friends; but last year, when my\\ncousins were with us and papa took a house for the season on the North\\nParade, \\'twas most enjoyable. I wish you had been there, instead of with\\nthat disagreeable Aunt Jennifer!\"\\n\\nShe kissed her relative most affectionately and lighted her across the\\nlanding to her room. Then she returned to her room and shut the door,\\ngiving a tired little yawn.\\n\\nIt was at about that moment that his Grace of Andover was ushered into\\nthe already crowded card-room of my Lord Avon\\'s house in Catharine\\nPlace, and was greeted with ribald cries of \"Oho, Belmanoir!\", and\\n\"Where\\'s the lady, Devil?\"\\n\\nHe walked coolly forward into the full light of a great pendant\\nchandelier, standing directly beneath it, the diamond order on his\\nbreast burning and winking like a living thing. The diamonds in his\\ncravat and on his fingers glittered every time he moved, until he seemed\\nto be carelessly powdered with iridescent gems. As usual, he was clad in\\nblack, but it would have been difficult to find any other dress in the\\nroom more sumptuous or more magnificent than his sable satin with its\\nheavy silver lacing, and shimmering waistcoat. Silver lace adorned his\\nthroat and fell in deep ruffles over his hands, and in defiance of\\nFashion, which decreed that black alone should be worn to tie the hair,\\nhe displayed long silver ribands, very striking against his unpowdered\\nhead.\\n\\nHe raised his quizzing glass and looked round the room with an air of\\nsurprised hauteur. Lord Avon, leaning back in his chair at one of the\\ntables, shook a reproving finger at him.\\n\\n\"Belmanoir, Belmanoir, we have seen her and we protest she is too\\ncharming for you!\"\\n\\n\"In truth, we think we should be allowed a share in the lady\\'th\\nthmileth,\" lisped one from behind him, and his Grace turned to face\\ndainty, effeminate little Viscount Fotheringham, who stood at his elbow,\\nresplendent in salmon-pink satin and primrose velvet, with skirts so\\nfull and stiffly whaleboned that they stood out from his person, and\\nheels so high that instead of walking he could only mince.\\n\\nTracy made a low leg.\\n\\n\"Surely shall you have a share in her smiles an she wills it so,\" he\\npurred, and a general laugh went up which caused the fop to flush to the\\nears, as he speedily effaced himself.\\n\\nHe had been one of those who had tried to accost Diana, and\\ngossip-loving Will Stapely, with him at the time, had related the story\\nof his discomfiture to at least half-a-dozen men, who immediately told\\nit to others, vastly amused at the pertinacious Viscount\\'s rebuff.\\n\\n\"What was it Selwyn said?\" drawled Sir Gregory Markham, shuffling cards\\nat Lord Avon\\'s table.\\n\\nDavenant looked across at him inquiringly.\\n\\n\"George? Of Belmanoir? When?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, at White\\'s one night--I forget--Jack Cholmondely was there--he\\nwould know; and Horry Walpole. \\'Twas of Devil and his light o\\'\\nloves--quite apt, on the whole.\"\\n\\nCholmondely looked up.\\n\\n\"Did I hear my name?\"\\n\\n\"Ay. What was it George said of Belmanoir at White\\'s the night Gilly\\nmade that absurd bet with Ffolliott?\"\\n\\n\"When Gilly--oh, yes, I remember. \\'Twas but an old hexameter tag,\\nplaying on his name: \\'_Est bellum bellis bellum bellare puellis_.\\' He\\nseemed to think it a fitting motto for a ducal house.\"\\n\\nThere was another general laugh at this. Markham broke in on it:\\n\\n\"Who is she, Tracy?\"\\n\\nHis Grace turned.\\n\\n\"Who is who?\" he asked languidly.\\n\\nLord Avon burst out laughing.\\n\\n\"Oh, come now, Belmanoir, that won\\'t do! It really will not! Who is she,\\nindeed!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, Belmanoir, who is the black-haired beauty, and where did you find\\nher?\" cried Tom Wilding, pressing forward with a glass in one hand and a\\nbottle of port in the other. \"I thought you were captivated by Cynthia\\nEvans?\"\\n\\nTracy looked bewildered for the moment, and then a light dawned on him.\\n\\n\"Evans! Ah, yes! The saucy widow who lived in Kensington, was it not? I\\nremember.\"\\n\\n\"He had forgotten!\" cried Avon, and went off into another of the noisy\\nlaughs that had more than once caused Mr. Nash to shudder and to close\\nhis august eyes. \"You\\'ll be the death of me, Devil! Gad! but you will!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I trust not. Thank you, Wilding.\" He accepted the glass that Tom\\noffered, and sipped delicately.\\n\\n\"But you\\'ve not answered!\" reminded Fortescue from another table. He\\ndealt the cards round expertly. \"Is it hands off, perhaps?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" replied his Grace. \"It generally is, Frank, as you know.\"\\n\\n\"To my cost!\" was the laughing rejoinder, and Fortescue rubbed his sword\\narm as if in memory of some hurt. \"You pinked me finely, Tracy!\"\\n\\n\"Clumsily, Frank, clumsily. It might have been quicker done.\"\\n\\nThe Viscount, who had been a second at the meeting, tittered amiably.\\n\\n\"Neatetht thing I ever thaw, \\'pon my honour. All over in leth than a\\nminute, Avon! Give you my word!\"\\n\\n\"Never knew you had fought Devil, Frank? What possessed you?\"\\n\\n\"I was more mad than usual, I suppose,\" replied Fortescue in his low,\\nrather dreamy voice, \"and I interfered between Tracy and his French\\nsinger. He objected most politely, and we fought it out in Hyde Park.\"\\n\\n\"Gad, yes!\" exclaimed his partner, Lord Falmouth. \"Why, I was Devil\\'s\\nsecond! But it was ages ago!\"\\n\\n\"Two years,\" nodded Fortescue, \"but I have not forgotten, you see!\"\\n\\n\"Lord, I had! And \\'twas the funniest fight I ever saw, with you as\\nfurious as could be and Devil cool as a cucumber. You were never much of\\na swordsman, Frank, but that morning you thrust so wildly that stap me\\nif I didn\\'t think Devil would run you through. \\'Stead of that he pinks\\nyou neatly through the sword-arm, and damme if you didn\\'t burst out\\nlaughing fit to split! And then we all walked off to breakfast with you,\\nFrank, as jolly as sandboys. Heavens, yes. That was a fight!\"\\n\\n\"It was amusing,\" admitted Tracy at Fortescue\\'s elbow. \"Don\\'t play,\\nFrank.\"\\n\\nFortescue flung his cards face downwards on the table. \"Curse you,\\nTracy, you\\'ve brought bad luck!\" he said entirely without rancour. \"I\\nhad quite tolerable hands before you came.\"\\n\\n\"Belmanoir, I will thtake my chestnut mare \\'gaintht your new grey,\"\\nlisped the Viscount, coming up to the table, dice-box in hand.\\n\\n\"Stap me, but that is too bad!\" cried Wilding. \"Don\\'t take him, Devil!\\nHave you seen the brute?\"\\n\\nThe four players had finished their card-playing and were quite ready\\nfor the dice.\\n\\n\"Trust in your luck, Belmanoir, and take him!\" advised Pritchard, who\\nloved hazarding other men\\'s possessions, but kept a tight hold on his\\nown.\\n\\n\"Ay, take him!\" echoed Falmouth.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t,\" said Fortescue.\\n\\n\"Of course I shall take him,\" answered his Grace tranquilly. \"My grey\\nagainst your chestnut and the best of three. Will you throw?\"\\n\\nThe Viscount rattled his box with a flourish. Two threes and a one\\nturned up.\\n\\nWith a hand on Fortescue\\'s shoulder, and one foot on the rung of his\\nchair, Tracy leaned forward and cast his own dice on to the table. He\\nhad beaten the Viscount\\'s throw by five. The next toss Fotheringham won,\\nbut the last fell to his Grace.\\n\\n\"Damnathion!\" said the Viscount cheerfully. \"Will you thtake your grey\\nagaintht my Terror?\"\\n\\n\"Thunder and turf, Fotheringham! You\\'ll lose him!\" cried Nettlefold\\nwarningly. \"Don\\'t stake the Terror!\"\\n\\n\"Nonthenth! Do you take me, Belmanoir?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said the Duke, and threw.\\n\\n\"Oh, an you are in a gaming mood, I will play you for the right to try\\nmy hand with the dark beauty!\" called Markham across the room.\\n\\n\"Against what?\" asked Fortescue.\\n\\n\"Oh, what he wills!\"\\n\\nThe Viscount had cast and lost, and his Grace won the second throw.\\n\\n\"It appears my luck is in,\" he remarked. \"I will stake my beauty against\\nyour estates, Markham.\"\\n\\nSir Gregory shook his head, laughing.\\n\\n\"No, no! Keep the lady!\"\\n\\n\"I intend to, my dear fellow. She is not your style. I begin to wonder\\nwhether she altogether suits my palate.\" He drew out his snuff-box and\\noffered it to his host, and the other men finding that he was proof\\nagainst their railing, allowed the subject to drop.\\n\\nIn the course of the evening his Grace won three thousand guineas--two\\nat ombre and one at dice--lost his coveted grey hunter and won him back\\nagain from Wilding, to whom he had fallen. He came away at three o\\'clock\\nin company with Fortescue, both perfectly cool-headed, although his\\nGrace, for his part, had imbibed a considerable quantity of burgundy,\\nand more punch than any ordinary man could take without afterwards\\nfeeling very much the worse for wear.\\n\\nAs my Lord Avon\\'s door closed behind them, Tracy turned to his friend:\\n\\n\"Shall we walk, Frank?\"\\n\\n\"Since our ways lie together, yes,\" replied Fortescue, linking his arm\\nin the Duke\\'s. \"Down Brock Street and across the Circus is our quickest\\nway.\"\\n\\nThey strolled down the road for a few moments in silence, passing a\\nlinkman on the way. Fortescue bade him a cheery good-night, which was\\nanswered in a very beery voice, but the Duke said nothing. Frank looked\\ninto his dark-browed face thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve had the luck, to-night, Tracy.\"\\n\\n\"Moderately. I hoped entirely to repair last week\\'s losses.\"\\n\\n\"You are in debt, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"I believe so.\"\\n\\n\"To what extent, Tracy?\"\\n\\n\"My dear fellow, I neither have, nor wish to have, the vaguest notion.\\nPray do not treat me to a sermon!\"\\n\\n\"I shall not. I\\'ve said all I have to say on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Many times.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--many times. And it has had no more effect upon you than if I had\\nnot spoken.\"\\n\\n\"Less.\"\\n\\n\"I daresay. I wish it were not so, for there\\'s good in you somewhere,\\nTracy.\"\\n\\n\"By what strange process of reasoning do you arrive at that?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Fortescue laughing, \"there\\'s nearly always some good in the\\nvery worst of men. I count on that--and your kindness to me.\"\\n\\n\"I should be interested to know when I have been kind to you--beyond the\\ntime when I was compelled to teach you to leave me and my affairs\\nalone.\"\\n\\n\"I was not referring to that occasion,\" was the dry answer. \"I had not\\nseen your act in that light. I meant well over the episode.\"\\n\\n\"You could not damn yourself more effectually than by saying that,\" said\\nhis Grace calmly. \"But we wander from the point. When have I done you an\\nact of kindness?\"\\n\\n\"You know very well. When you extricated me from that cursed\\nsponging-house.\"\\n\\n\"I remember now. Yes, that _was_ good of me. I wonder why I did it?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis what I want to know.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose I must have had some sort of an affection for you. I would\\ncertainly never have done such a thing for anyone else.\"\\n\\n\"Not even for your own brother!\" said Frank sharply.\\n\\nThey had crossed the Circus and were walking down Gay Street now.\\n\\n\"Least of all for them,\" came the placid response. \"You are thinking of\\nAndrew\\'s tragic act? Most entertaining, was it not?\"\\n\\n\"You evidently found it so.\"\\n\\n\"I did. I wanted to prolong the sensation, but my esteemed\\nbrother-in-law came to the young fool\\'s rescue.\"\\n\\n\"Would you have assisted him?\"\\n\\n\"In the end I fear I should have had to.\"\\n\\n\"I believe there must be a kink in your brain!\" cried Fortescue. \"I\\ncannot else account for your extraordinary conduct!\"\\n\\n\"We Belmanoirs are all half-mad,\" replied Tracy sweetly, \"but I think\\nthat in my case it is merely concentrated evil.\"\\n\\n\"I will not believe it! You have shown that you can behave differently!\\nYou do not try to strip me of all I possess--why all those unfortunate\\nyouths you play with?\"\\n\\n\"You see, you possess so little,\" the Duke excused himself.\\n\\n\"Neither do you sneer at me in your loathsome fashion. Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because I have hardly ever any desire to. I like you.\"\\n\\n\"Tare an\\' ouns! you must like someone else in the world besides me?\"\\n\\n\"I can think of no one. And I do not exactly worship the ground _you_\\ntread on. The contemplation of my brothers appals me. I have loved\\nvarious women, and shall no doubt love many more--\"\\n\\n\"No, Tracy,\" interposed Fortescue, \"you have never loved a woman in your\\nlife. \\'Tis that that might save you. I do not allude to the lustful\\npassion you indulge in, but real love. For God\\'s sake Belmanoir, live\\nclean!\"\\n\\n\"Pray do not distress yourself, Frank. I am not worth it.\"\\n\\n\"I choose to think that you are. I cannot but feel that if you had been\\nloved as a boy--Your mother--\"\\n\\n\"Did you ever see my mother?\" inquired his Grace lazily.\\n\\n\"No--but--\"\\n\\n\"Have you ever seen my sister?\"\\n\\n\"Er--yes--\"\\n\\n\"In a rage?\"\\n\\n\"Really, I--\"\\n\\n\"Because, if you have, you have seen my mother. Only she was ten times\\nmore violent. In fact, we were a pleasant party when we were all at\\nhome.\"\\n\\n\"I understand.\"\\n\\n\"Good Gad! I believe you are sorry for me?\" cried Tracy scornfully.\\n\\n\"I am. Is it a presumption on my part?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Frank, when I am sorry for myself you may be sorry too. Until\\nthen--\"\\n\\n\"When that day comes I shall no longer pity you.\"\\n\\n\"Very deep, Frank! You think I shall be on the road to recovery? A\\npretty conceit. Luckily, the happy moment has not yet come--and I do not\\nthink it is like to. We appear to have arrived.\"\\n\\nThey were standing outside one of the tall houses where Fortescue\\nlodged. He turned and grasped his friend\\'s shoulders.\\n\\n\"Tracy, give up this mad life you lead! Give up the women and the drink,\\nand the excessive gaming; for one day, believe me, you will overstep\\nyourself and be ruined!\"\\n\\nThe Duke disengaged himself.\\n\\n\"I very much object to being man-handled in the street,\" he complained.\\n\"I suppose you still _mean_ well. You should strive to conquer the\\ntendency.\"\\n\\n\"I wonder if you know how insolent is your tone, Belmanoir?\" asked\\nFortescue steadily.\\n\\n\"Naturally. I should not have attained such perfection in the art else.\\nBut pray accept my thanks for your good advice. You will forgive me an I\\ndo not avail myself of it, I am sure. I prefer the crooked path.\"\\n\\n\"Evidently,\" sighed the other. \"If you will not try the straight and\\nnarrow way, I can only hope that you will fall very deeply and very\\nhonestly in love; and that the lady will save you from yourself.\"\\n\\n\"I will inform you of it when it comes to pass,\" promised his Grace.\\n\"And now: good-night!\"\\n\\n\"Good-night!\" Frank returned the low bow with a curt nod. \"I shall see\\nyou to-morrow--that is, this morning--at the Baths?\"\\n\\n\"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,\" was the smiling\\nrejoinder. \"Sleep soundly, Frank!\" He waved an ironic farewell and\\ncrossed the road to his own lodgings, which stood almost directly\\nopposite.\\n\\n\"And I suppose _you_ will sleep as soundly as if you had not a stain on\\nyour conscience--and had not tried your uttermost to alienate the regard\\nof the only friend you possess,\" remarked Frank bitterly to the\\ndarkness. \"Damn you, Tracy, for the villain you are!\" He walked up the\\nsteps to his own front door and turned the key in the lock. He looked\\nover his shoulder as a door slammed across the street. \"Poor Devil!\" he\\nsaid. \"Oh, you poor Devil!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\nTHE BITER BIT\\n\\n\\nWith John Carstares the winter had passed quite uneventfully. He\\ncontinued his highway robbery, but he made two bad blunders--not from\\nthe point of view of a thief, but from that of the gentleman in him. The\\nfirst was when he stopped an opulent-looking chariot, which he found to\\ncontain two ladies, their maid and their jewels, and the second when the\\noccupant of a large travelling coach chanced to be an old gentleman who\\npossessed far greater courage than physical strength. On the first\\noccasion my lord\\'s dismay had been ludicrous, and he had hastily retired\\nafter tendering a naive apology. The old gentleman in the second episode\\nhad defied him so gallantly that he had impulsively offered him the butt\\nend of one of his pistols. The old man was so surprised that he allowed\\nthe weapon to fall to the ground, where it exploded quite harmlessly,\\nsending up a cloud of dust and smoke. Carstares then begged his pardon\\nmost humbly, assisted him back into his coach, and rode off before the\\nastonished Mr. Dunbar had time to collect his wits.\\n\\nThe robbing was not carried out in a very scientific manner, for, as has\\nbeen seen, Carstares could not bring himself to terrorise women or old\\nmen, and there only remained the young and the middle-aged gentlemen,\\none of whom Jack offered to fight for the possession of his jewels. His\\nchallenge was promptly accepted by the man, who happened to possess a\\nstrong sense of humour, and probably saw a chance of saving his\\nbelongings in the offer. He had been speedily worsted, but Carstares was\\nso pleased with a particularly neat thrust which he had executed, that\\nhe forwent half the booty, and the pair of them divided the contents of\\nthe jewel-box by the roadside, the sporting gentleman keeping his most\\nvalued belongings and giving Jack the surplus. They parted on the very\\nbest of terms, and all Carstares got out of the episode was a little\\nsword practice and a few trinkets.\\n\\nWhen day came he was patrolling the west side of Sussex, beyond\\nMidhurst, not because he thought it a profitable part, but because he\\nknew and loved the country. One late afternoon towards the end of the\\nmonth he rode gaily into one of the small villages that nestle amongst\\nthe Downs, and made his way down the quaint main street to the George\\nInn, where he drew rein and dismounted. At his call an aged ostler\\nhobbled out of a side door, chewing an inevitable straw, and after\\neyeing the newcomer and his steed for an appreciable length of time,\\nevidently decided that they were worthy of his attention, for he came\\nforward, remarking that it had been a pleasant day.\\n\\nCarstares agreed with him, and volunteered the information that it would\\nbe another fine day to-morrow, if the sunset were to be trusted. To this\\nthe ostler replied that he, for one, never trusted to no red sunsets,\\nand added darkly that there warn\\'t nothing so deceitful to his manner o\\'\\nthinking. He\\'d known it be such a red sunset as never was, and yet be\\na-pouring with rain all next day.... Should he take the mare?\\n\\nCarstares shook his head.\\n\\n\"No, I thank you. I remain here but a few moments. I doubt she\\'s thirsty\\nthough--eh, Jenny?\"\\n\\n\"Water, sir?\"\\n\\n\"For her, yes. For myself I fancy a tankard of your home-brewed ale.\\nStand, Jenny!\" He turned away and walked up the steps to the inn door.\\n\\n\"Be you a-going to leave her there, sir--a-standing all by herself?\"\\ninquired the man, surprised.\\n\\n\"Why, yes! She\\'s docile enough.\"\\n\\n\"Well! Seems to me a risky thing to leave a hoss--and a skittish hoss at\\nthat--a-standing loose in the road. Ye won\\'t be tying her to a post,\\nmaster?\"\\n\\nCarstares leaned his arms on the balustrade and looked down at them.\\n\\n\"I will not. She\\'d be very hurt at such treatment, wouldn\\'t you, lass?\"\\n\\nJenny tossed her head playfully, as if in agreement, and the ostler\\nscratched his head, looking from her to my lord:\\n\\n\"A\\'most seems as if she understands what you be a-saying to her, sir!\"\\n\\n\"Of course she understands! Don\\'t I tell you \\'tis a clever little lady?\\nIf I call her now she\\'ll come up these steps to me, and not all the\\nostlers in Christendom could stop her.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t\\'ee go for to do it, sir!\" urged the old man, backing. \"She must\\nbe uncommon fond o\\' ye?\"\\n\\n\"She\\'d be a deal fonder of you if you\\'d fetch her a drink,\" hinted Jack\\nbroadly.\\n\\n\"Ay, sir! I be a-going this werry instant!\" And with many an anxious\\nglance over his shoulder at the perfectly quiet mare, he disappeared\\nthrough an open doorway into the yard.\\n\\nWhen Carstares, tankard of ale in hand, emerged from the inn and sat\\nhimself down on one of the benches that stood against the wall, the\\nmare was drinking thirstily from a bucket which the ancient one held for\\nher.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a wunnerful fine mare, sir,\" he remarked at length, after a\\ncareful inspection of her points.\\n\\nCarstares nodded pleasantly, and surveyed Jenny through half-shut eyes.\\n\\n\"I think so every time I look at her,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I should think she could get a bit of a pace on her, sir? Mebbe ye\\'ve\\ntried her racing?\"\\n\\n\"No, she wasn\\'t brought up to that. But she\\'s fast enough.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, sir. No vices?\"\\n\\n\"Lord, no!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t kick neither?\"\\n\\n\"Not with me.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! they allus knows who\\'ll stand it and who won\\'t.\"\\n\\nJack drained his tankard, and setting it down on the bench beside him,\\nrose to his feet.\\n\\n\"She\\'d not dream of kicking a friend. Jenny!\"\\n\\nThe ostler watched her pick her way towards her master, coquetting with\\nher head, and sidling round him in the most playful manner possible. A\\nslow smile dawned on the man\\'s face.\\n\\n\"Ah, it be a purty sight to watch her--so it be!\" he said, and received\\na guinea from Jack, who never tired of listening to praise of his\\nbeloved Jenny.\\n\\nCarstares remounted, nodded farewell to the ostler and rode leisurely on\\ndown the street, soon branching off to the right into a typical Sussex\\nlane, where he trotted between uneven hedges, sweet with blossom and\\nwith May, and placid fields rolling away on either side, upwards until\\nthey merged into the undulating hills, barely discernible in the gloom,\\nthat are the downs. It was a wonderfully calm evening, with only a\\ngentle west wind blowing, and the moon already shining faintly in the\\ndark sky. There was nothing beyond the sound of the mare\\'s hoofs to\\nbreak the beautiful stillness of it all.\\n\\nHe rode for some way without meeting a soul, and when at the end of an\\nhour someone did chance along the road it was only a labourer returning\\nhome to his supper after a long day in the fields. John bade him a\\ncheery good evening and watched him pass on down the road humming.\\n\\nAfter that he met no one. He rode easily along for miles, into the\\nfast-gathering darkness. He was frowning as he rode, thinking.\\n\\nCuriously enough, it was on his penniless days in France that his mind\\ndwelt this evening. He had resolutely thrust that dark time behind him,\\ndetermined to forget it, but there were still days when, try as he\\nmight, he could not prevent his thoughts flying back to it.\\n\\nWith clenched teeth he recalled the days when he, the son of an Earl,\\nhad taught fencing in Paris for a living.... Suddenly he laughed\\nharshly, and at the unusual sound the mare pricked up her ears and\\nsidled uneasily across the road. For once no notice was taken of her,\\nand she quickened her pace with a flighty toss of her head....\\n\\nHe thought how he, the extravagant John, had pinched and scraped and\\nsaved rather than go under; how he had lived in one of the poorer\\n_quartiers_ of the city, alone, without friends--nameless.\\n\\nThen, cynically now, he reviewed the time when he had taken to drinking,\\nheavily and systematically, and had succeeded in pulling himself up at\\nthe very brink of the pit he saw yawning before him.\\n\\nNext the news of his mother\\'s death.... John passed over that quickly.\\nEven now the thought of it had the power of rousing in him all the old\\nmisery and impotent resentment.\\n\\nHis mind sped on to his Italian days. On his savings he had travelled to\\nFlorence, and from there he went gradually south, picking up all the\\nlatest arts and subtleties of fence on the way.\\n\\nThe change of scene and of people did much to restore his spirits. His\\ndevil-may-care ways peeped out again; he started to gamble on the little\\nmoney he had left. For once Fortune proved kind; he doubled and trebled\\nand quadrupled the contents of his purse. Then it was that he met Jim\\nSalter, whom he engaged as his servant. This was the first friend since\\nhe had left England. Together they travelled about Europe, John gambling\\nhis way, Jim keeping a relentless hand on the exchequer. It was entirely\\nowing to his watchfulness and care that John was not ruined, for his\\nluck did not always hold good, and there were days when he lost with\\ndistressing steadiness. But Jim guarded the winnings jealously, and\\nthere was always something to fall back on.\\n\\nAt last the longing for England and English people grew so acute that\\nJohn made up his mind to return. But he found that things in England\\nwere very different from what they had been abroad. Here he was made to\\nfeel acutely that he was outcast. It was impossible to live in town\\nunder an assumed name, as he would like to have done, for too many\\npeople knew Jack Carstares, and would remember him. He saw that he must\\neither live secluded, or--and the idea of becoming a highwayman occurred\\nto him. A hermit\\'s existence he knew to be totally unsuited to a man of\\nhis temperament, but the free, adventurous spirit of the road appealed\\nto him. The finding of his mare--J. the Third, as he laughingly dubbed\\nher--decided the point; he forthwith took on himself the role of\\nquixotic highwayman, roaming his beloved South Country, happier than he\\nhad been since he first left England; bit by bit regaining his youth and\\nspirits, which last, not all the trouble he had been through had\\nsucceeded in extinguishing....\\n\\nClip-clap, clip-clop.... With a jerk he came back to earth and reined-in\\nhis mare, the better to listen.\\n\\nAlong the road came the unmistakable sound of horses\\' hoofs, and the\\nscrunch-scrunch of swiftly-revolving wheels on the sandy surface.\\n\\nBy now the moon was right out, but owing to the fact that she was\\nplaying at hide-and-seek in and out of the clouds, it was fairly dark.\\nNevertheless, Jack fastened his mask over his face with quick, deft\\nfingers, and pulled his hat well over his eyes. His ears told him that\\nthe vehicle, whatever it was, was coming towards him, so he drew into\\nthe side of the road, and taking a pistol from its holster, sat waiting,\\nhis eyes on the bend in the road.\\n\\nNearer and nearer came the horses, until the leader swung round the\\ncorner. Carstares saw that it was an ordinary travelling chariot, and\\nlevelled his pistol.\\n\\n\"Halt, or I fire!\" He had to repeat the command before it was heard, and\\nto ride out from the shadow of the hedge.\\n\\nThe chariot drew up and the coachman leaned over the side to see who it\\nwas bidding them to stop in so peremptory a manner.\\n\\n\"What d\\'ye want? Who are ye? Is there aught amiss?\" he cried testily,\\nand found himself staring at a long-nosed pistol.\\n\\n\"Throw down your arms!\"\\n\\n\"I ain\\'t got none, blast ye!\"\\n\\n\"On your honour?\" Jack dismounted.\\n\\n\"Ay! Wish I had, and I\\'d see ye damned afore I\\'d throw \\'em down!\"\\n\\nAt this moment the door of the coach opened and a gentleman leapt\\nlightly down on to the road. He was big and loose-limbed as far as\\nCarstares could see, and carried himself with an easy grace.\\n\\nMy lord presented his pistol.\\n\\n\"Stand!\" he ordered gruffly.\\n\\nThe moon peeped coyly out from behind a cloud and shed her light upon\\nthe little group as if to see what all the fuss was about. The big man\\'s\\nface was in the shadow, but Jack\\'s pistol was not. Into its muzzle the\\ngentleman gazed, one hand deep in the pocket of his heavy cloak, the\\nother holding a small pistol.\\n\\n\"Me very dear friend,\" he said in a rich brogue, \"perhaps ye are not\\naware that that same pistol ye are pointing at me is unloaded? Don\\'t\\nmove; I have ye covered!\"\\n\\nJack\\'s arm fell to his side, and the pistol he held clattered to the\\nground. But it was not surprise at Jim\\'s defection that caused him that\\nviolent start. It was something far more overwhelming. For the voice\\nthat proceeded from the tall gentleman belonged to one whom, six years\\nago, he had counted, next to Richard, his greatest friend on earth.\\n\\nThe man moved a little, and the moonlight shone full on his face,\\nclearly outlining the large nose and good-humoured mouth, and above, the\\nsleepy grey eyes. Miles! Miles O\\'Hara! For once Jack could find nothing\\namusing in the situation. It was too inconceivably hideous that he\\nshould meet his friend in this guise, and, further, be unable to reveal\\nhimself. A great longing to tear off his mask and to grasp Miles\\' hand\\nassailed him. With an effort he choked it down and listened to what\\nO\\'Hara was saying:\\n\\n\"If ye will be so kind as to give me your word of honour ye\\'ll not be\\nafther trying to escape, I should be greatly obliged. But I tell ye\\nfirst that if ye attempt to move, I shall shoot.\"\\n\\nJack made a hopeless gesture with his hand. He felt dazed. The whole\\nthing was ridiculous; how Miles would laugh afterwards. He went cold.\\nThere would be no \"afterwards\".... Miles would never know.... He would\\nbe given over to the authorities, and Miles would never know that he had\\nhelped Jack Carstares to the scaffold.... Perhaps, too, he would not\\nmind so very much, now that he, Jack, was so disgraced. One could never\\ntell; even if he risked everything now, and told his true identity,\\nMiles might turn away from him in disgust; Miles, who could never stoop\\nto a dishonourable act. Carstares felt that he would bear anything\\nsooner than face this man\\'s scorn....\\n\\n\"Never tell me \\'tis a dumb man ye are, for I heard ye shout meself! Do\\nye give me your word of honour, or must I have ye bound?\"\\n\\nCarstares pulled himself together and set his teeth as he faced the\\ninevitable. Escape was impossible; Miles would shoot, he felt sure, and\\nthen his disguise would be torn away and his friend would see that Jack\\nCarstares was nothing but a common highwayman. Whatever happened, that\\nmust not be, for the sake of the name and Richard. So he quietly held\\nout his hands.\\n\\n\"Ay, I give my word, but ye can bind me if ye choose.\" It was his\\nhighwayman voice: raucous, and totally unlike his own.\\n\\nBut O\\'Hara\\'s eyes were fixed on the slender white hands held out to him.\\nIn his usual haphazard fashion, Jack had quite forgotten to grime his\\nhands. They were shapely and white, and carefully manicured.\\n\\nMiles took either wrist in his large hands and turned them palm upwards\\nin the moonlight.\\n\\n\"Singularly white hands ye have, for one in your profession,\" he\\ndrawled, and tightened his hold as Jack tried to draw them away. \"No, ye\\ndo not! Now be so good as to step within, me friend.\"\\n\\nJack held back an instant.\\n\\n\"My mare?\" he asked, and O\\'Hara noted the anxiety in his voice.\\n\\n\"Ye need not be after worrying about her,\" he said. \"George!\" The\\nfootman sprang forward.\\n\\n\"Yessir?\"\\n\\n\"Ye see that mare? I want ye to ride her home. Can ye do it?\"\\n\\n\"Yessir!\"\\n\\n\"I doubt it,\" murmured Jack.\\n\\nSo did Jenny. She refused point blank to allow this stranger to mount\\nher. Her master had left her in one spot, and there she would stand\\nuntil he chose to bid her move. In vain did the groom coax and coerce.\\nShe ran round him and seemed a transformed creature. She laid her ears\\nflat and gnashed at the bit, ready to lash out furiously at the first\\nopportunity.\\n\\nJack watched the man\\'s futile struggles with the ghost of a smile about\\nhis lips.\\n\\n\"Jenny!\" he said quietly, and O\\'Hara looked round at him sharply,\\nfrowning. Unconsciously, he had spoken naturally, and the voice was\\nfaintly familiar.\\n\\nJenny twitched the bridle from the perspiring groom and minced up to the\\nprisoner.\\n\\n\"Would ye allow me to have a hand free--sir?\" he asked. \"Mebbe I can\\nmanage her.\"\\n\\nWithout a word Miles released him, and he caught the bridle, murmuring\\nsomething unintelligible to the now quiet animal.\\n\\nO\\'Hara watched the beautiful hand stroke her muzzle reassuringly, and\\nfrowned again. No ordinary highwayman this.\\n\\n\"Mount her now, will \\'ee?\" Jack flung at the groom, and kept a warning\\nhand on the rein as the man obeyed. With a final pat he turned away.\\n\"She\\'ll do now, sir.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara nodded.\\n\\n\"Ye\\'ve trained her well. Get in, please.\"\\n\\nJack obeyed, and in a minute or two O\\'Hara jumped in after him, and the\\ncoach began to move forward.\\n\\nFor a while there was silence, Carstares keeping himself well under\\ncontrol. It was almost unbearable to think that after this brief drive\\nhe would never set eyes on his friend again, and he wanted so badly to\\nturn and grasp that strong hand....\\n\\nMiles turned in his seat and tried to see the masked face in the\\ndarkness.\\n\\n\"Ye are a gentleman?\" he asked, going straight to the point.\\n\\nJack was prepared for this.\\n\\n\"Me, sir? Lor\\' no, sir!\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe ye. Don\\'t be forgettin\\' I\\'ve seen your hands!\"\\n\\n\"Hands, sir?\" in innocent bewilderment.\\n\\n\"Sure, ye don\\'t think I\\'d be believing ye an ordinary rogue, with hands\\nlike that?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t rightly understand ye, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Bejabers then, ye\\'ll be understanding me tomorrow!\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. Ye may as well tell me now as then. I\\'m not such a daft fool\\nas I look, and I know a gentleman when I see one, even an he does growl\\nat me as you do!\" he chuckled. \"And I\\'d an odd feeling I knew ye when ye\\nspoke to the mare. I\\'d be loth to send a friend to the gallows.\"\\n\\nHow well Jack knew that soft, persuasive voice. His hands clenched as he\\nforced himself to answer:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen ye afore, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe ye have not. We shall see to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"What do ye mean by to-morrow, sir?\" ventured Carstares uneasily.\\n\\n\"Sure, ye will have the honour of appearing before me, me friend.\"\\n\\n\"Before _you_, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Why not? I\\'m a Justice of the Peace, heaven save the mark!\"\\n\\nThere was a breathless pause, and then at last the funny side of it\\nstruck Jack, and his shoulders shook with suppressed laughter. The\\nexquisite irony of it was almost too much for him. He, the Earl of\\nWyncham, was to be formally questioned by his friend Sir Miles O\\'Hara,\\nJ.P.!\\n\\n\"What ails ye now, man? Ye find it amusing?\" asked Miles, surprised.\\n\\n\"Oh, Lud, yes!\" gasped Jack, and collapsed into his corner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\nLADY O\\'HARA INTERVENES\\n\\n\\nLady O\\'Hara found that her big, indolent husband was unusually silent\\nnext morning at breakfast. She had not been married long enough to\\nconsent to being practically ignored, no matter what the time of day,\\nbut she had been married quite long enough to know that before she took\\nany direct action against him, she must first allow him to assuage his\\nappetite. Accordingly she plied him with coffee and eggs, and with a\\nsatisfied and slightly motherly air, watched him attack a sirloin of\\nbeef. She was a pretty, birdlike little lady, with big eyes, and soft\\nbrown curls escaping from under a demure but very becoming mob cap. She\\nmeasured five foot nothing in her stockings, and was sometimes referred\\nto by her large husband as the Midget. Needless to say, this flippant\\nappellation was in no wise encouraged by the lady.\\n\\nShe decided that Miles had come to the end of his repast, and, planting\\ntwo dimpled elbows on the table, she rested her small chin in her hands\\nand looked across at him with something of the air of an inquisitive\\nkitten.\\n\\n\"Miles!\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara leaned back in his chair, and at the sight of her fresh\\nprettiness his brow cleared and he smiled.\\n\\n\"Well, asthore?\"\\n\\nA reproachful finger was raised and a pair of red lips pouted adorably.\\n\\n\"Now, Miles, confess you\\'ve been vastly disagreeable this morning. Twice\\nhave I spoken to you and you\\'ve not troubled to answer me--nay, let me\\nfinish! And once you growled at me like a nasty bear! Yes, sir, you\\ndid!\"\\n\\n\"Did I now, Molly? \\'Tis a surly brute you\\'re after thinking me, then?\\nTroth, and I\\'ve been sore perplexed, me dear.\"\\n\\nLady O\\'Hara got up and sidled round to him.\\n\\n\"Have you so, Miles?\"\\n\\nHe flung an arm about her and drew her on to his knee.\\n\\n\"Sure, yes, Molly.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, Miles, had you not better tell me what it is that troubles\\nyou?\" she coaxed, laying a persuasive hand on his shoulder.\\n\\nHe smiled up at her.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis just an inquisitive puss you are!\"\\n\\nAgain the pout.\\n\\n\"And ye should not pout your pretty lips at me if ye are not wanting me\\nto kiss them!\" he added, suiting the action to the word.\\n\\n\"But of course I do!\" cried my lady, returning the kiss with fervour.\\n\"Nay, Miles, tell me.\"\\n\\n\"I see ye mean to have the whole tale out of me, so--\"\\n\\n\"To be sure I do!\" she nodded.\\n\\nHe laid a warning finger on her lips and summoned up a mighty frown.\\n\\n\"Now will ye be done interrupting, me lady?\"\\n\\nNot a whit abashed, she bit the finger, pushed it away, and folding her\\nhands in her lap, cast her eyes meekly heavenwards.\\n\\nWith a twinkle in his own eyes the Irishman continued:\\n\\n\"Well, alanna, ye must know that yesterday evening I was at Kilroy\\'s on\\na matter of business--and that reminds me, Molly, we had a hand or two\\nat faro and the like before I left, and I had very distressing luck--\"\\n\\nOn a sudden my lady\\'s demure air vanished.\\n\\n\"Is that so, Miles? I make no doubt the stakes were prodigious high?\\nPray, how much have you lost?\"\\n\\n\"Whisht, darlin\\', \\'tis a mere thrifle, I assure you.... Well, as I was\\nsaying, on me way home, what should happen but that we be held up by one\\nof these highwaymen--\"\\n\\nMy lady\\'s eyes widened in horror, and two little hands clutched at his\\ncoat.\\n\\n\"Oh, Miles!\"\\n\\nHis arm tightened round her waist.\\n\\n\"Sure, asthore, I\\'m still alive to tell the tale, though \\'tis not far\\nI\\'ll be getting with you interrupting at every moment!\"\\n\\n\"But, Miles, how terrible! You might have been killed! And you never\\ntold me! \\'Twas monstrous wicked of you, darling!\"\\n\\n\"Faith, Molly, how should I be telling you when \\'twas yourself that was\\nfast asleep? Now will you whisht?\"\\n\\nShe nodded obediently, and dimpled.\\n\\n\"Well, as I say, here was this man standing in the road, pointing his\\npistol at me. But will ye believe me, me love, when I tell you that that\\nsame pistol was as empty as--my own?\" Here he was shaken with laughter.\\n\"Lud, Molly, \\'twas the drollest thing! I had me pistol in me hand,\\nknowing \\'twas unloaded, and wondering what the devil, saving your\\npresence, was to do next, when the idea struck me that I should try to\\nbluff me fine sir. So I cried out that his pistol was unloaded, and\\ncompletely took him by surprise! Sure he hadn\\'t time to ask himself how\\nthe devil I should be knowing that! He dropped it on the road. Afther--\"\\n\\n\"Miles, you are becoming very Irish!\"\\n\\n\"Never say so, alanna. _After_ that \\'twas simple enough, and me lord\\ngave in. He held out his hands for me to bind--and here\\'s where \\'tis\\npuzzling, Molly--I saw that they were a prodigious sight too white and\\nfine for an ordinary highwayman. So I taxed him with it--\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twas a gentleman in disguise! How splendid, Miles!\"\\n\\n\"Will ye hold your tongue, asthore, and not be spoiling me story on me?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed I am sorry! I will be good!\"\\n\\n\"--and he started and seemed monstrous put out. What\\'s more, me dear, I\\nheard him speak to his mare in an ordinary, gentleman\\'s voice. Molly, ye\\nnever saw the like of that same mare! The sweetest--\"\\n\\n\"Pray, never mind the mare, dear! I am all agog to hear about the\\ngentleman-highwayman!\"\\n\\n\"Very well, me love, though \\'twas a prodigious fine mare--When I heard\\nhim speak, it flashed across me brain that I knew him--no, ye don\\'t,\\nMolly!\" His hand was over her mouth as he spoke, and her eyes danced\\nmadly. \"But I could not for the life of me think where I had heard that\\nvoice: \\'twas but the one word I heard him speak, ye understand, and when\\nI held his wrists I felt that \\'twas no stranger. And yet \\'tis\\nimpossible. When I got him within the coach--\"\\n\\n\"How imprudent! He might have--\"\\n\\n\"Whisht now! When I got him within the coach I tried to worm his\\nidentity out of him, but \\'twas to no avail. But when I told him he would\\nhave to appear before me to-day, he went off into a fit of laughing,\\ntill I wondered what he was at, at all. And not another word could I get\\nout of him after beyond \\'Yes, sir,\\' and \\'No, sir.\\' Still, I felt that\\n\\'twas a gentleman all the same, so I--\"\\n\\nHe was enveloped in a rapturous embrace.\\n\\n\"You dear Miles! You let him escape?\"\\n\\n\"Sure, alanna, is it meself that would be doing the like? And me a\\nJustice of the Peace withal? I told them not to handcuff me lord.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I do so wish you had let him escape! But if \\'tis really a\\ngentleman, you will?\"\\n\\n\"I will not then, asthore. I\\'ll be sending him to await the Assizes.\"\\n\\n\"You are very cruel, then.\"\\n\\n\"But, me darlin\\'--\"\\n\\n\"And I wish to get off your knee.\" He drew her close.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll see what can be done for your protege, Molly. But don\\'t be\\nforgetting he tried to kill the only husband you have!\" He watched the\\neffect of this with that humorous twinkle in his eye. But my lady was\\nnot to be put off.\\n\\n\"With an empty pistol? Fie on you, Miles! And may I hide behind the\\nscreen while you question him?\"\\n\\n\"Ye may not.\"\\n\\n\"But I wish so much to see him!\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara shook his head with an air of finality she knew full well.\\nHowever easy-going and good-natured her husband might be, there were\\ntimes when he was impervious to all blandishments. So after darkly\\nhinting that she would be nearer than he imagined, she gave up the\\ncontest to go and visit young Master David in his nursery.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFor some time in lock-up Carstares had cudgelled his brain to think out\\na possible mode of escape next day, but try as he might he could light\\non nothing. If only Miles were not to question him! It was hardly likely\\nthat he would be allowed to retain his mask, yet therein lay his only\\nchance of preserving his incognito. He prayed that by some merciful\\nprovidence O\\'Hara would either fail to recognise him or would at least\\npretend that he did not. Having decided that there was nothing further\\nto be done in the matter he lay down on his extremely hard pallet, and\\nwent to sleep as if he had not a care in the world.\\n\\nNext morning, after a long and wordy argument with the head gaoler on\\nthe subject of masks, he was haled in triumph to the house.\\n\\nAs the little cavalcade was about to ascend the steps that led to the\\nfront door, my Lady O\\'Hara came gaily forth carrying a basket and a pair\\nof scissors, and singing a snatch of song. At the sight of the\\nhighwayman the song broke off and her red lips formed a long-drawn \"Oh!\"\\nShe stood quite still on the top step, gazing down at my lord. The two\\ngaolers stood aside to allow her to come down, just as a greyhound\\ndarted up the steps and flung itself against her in an exuberance of\\njoy. My lady, none too securely balanced, reeled; the basket fell from\\nher arm, her foot missed the next step, and she tumbled headlong down.\\nBut in the flash of an eyelid Carstares had sprung forward and received\\nher in his arms. He lowered her gently to the ground. \"I trust you are\\nnot hurt, madam?\" he asked, and retrieved her basket, handing it to her.\\n\\nMolly took it with a smile.\\n\\n\"I thank you sir, not at all; though I fear I should have injured myself\\nquite considerably had you not been so swift in catching me. \\'Twas most\\nkind of you, I am sure!\" She extended her small hand, and her eyes\\ndevoured him.\\n\\nFor a moment my lord hesitated, and then, sweeping off his hat, he bowed\\nlow over the hand.\\n\\n\"\\'Twas less than nothing, madam,\" he said in his own cultivated voice.\\n\"I beg you will dismiss it from your mind.\" He straightened himself as\\nthe gaolers came forward, and put on his hat again.\\n\\nLady O\\'Hara stepped aside and watched them disappear into the house. Her\\ncheeks were rather flushed, and her eyes suspiciously bright. Suddenly\\nshe nodded her head decisively, and throwing away her luckless basket,\\nhurried across the lawn and entered the house through a long window.\\n\\nMy lord was conducted to the library, where O\\'Hara sat awaiting him, and\\nslouched forward with his hands thrust deep into his pockets and his hat\\nstill on his head.\\n\\nThe head gaoler eyed him gloomily, and looked pained when Carstares with\\nstudied boorishness leaned carelessly against a fine carved table.\\n\\n\"We \\'ave refrained from \\'andcuffin\\' pris\\'ner, sir, at your horders,\" he\\nsaid, in a tone that warned O\\'Hara that should harm come of it, on his\\nhead be the blame.\\n\\nMiles nodded.\\n\\n\"Quite right,\" he said pleasantly, and glanced at the cloaked and masked\\nfigure before him with more suspicion than ever.\\n\\n\"But I regrets to \\'ave to report very hobstinate be\\'aviour on part of\\npris\\'ner, sir,\" added the gaoler impressively.\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said Miles gravely. \"How so?\"\\n\\nJack controlled an insane desire to laugh, and listened to the gaoler\\'s\\ncomplaint.\\n\\n\"You see the pris\\'ner, sir, with that great mask on \\'is face? Afore we\\nset out to come \\'ere, I told \\'im to take it hoff. And \\'e refoosed, sir.\\nSeeing as \\'ow you gave no horders, I did not force \\'im to hobey.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! ... Your name, please?\"\\n\\n\"John Smith, sir,\" answered Carstares promptly and hoarsely. O\\'Hara\\nwrote it down with a sceptical smile on his lips that Jack did not quite\\nlike.\\n\\n\"Perhaps ye will have the goodness to unmask?\"\\n\\nThere was a momentary silence.\\n\\n\"Why, sir, I thought ye might allow me to keep it on?\"\\n\\n\"Did ye now? I will not be allowing any such thing.\"\\n\\n\"But, sir--\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis impossible. Off with it!\"\\n\\n\"Sir--\"\\n\\n\"If ye don\\'t take it off, I shall ask these men to assist ye,\" warned\\nMiles.\\n\\n\"May I not speak with ye alone, sir?\" pleaded Jack. By now O\\'Hara was\\ngreatly intrigued.\\n\\n\"Ye may not. Unmask!\" He was leaning half across the table, his eyes\\nfixed on Jack\\'s face.\\n\\nWith a quaint little laugh that made O\\'Hara\\'s brows contract swiftly, my\\nlord shrugged his shoulders French fashion and obeyed. The mask and hat\\nwere tossed lightly on to the table, and Miles found himself gazing into\\na pair of blue eyes that met his half defiantly, half imploringly. He\\ndrew in his breath sharply and the thin ivory rule he held snapped\\nsuddenly between his fingers. And at that crucial moment a door behind\\nhim that had stood ajar was pushed open, and my Lady O\\'Hara came\\ntripping into the room.\\n\\nThe two gaolers and her husband turned at once to see who it was, while\\nJack, who had recognised her, but had not the least idea who she was,\\nfell to dusting his boots with his handkerchief.\\n\\nO\\'Hara rose, and for once looked severe.\\n\\n\"What--\" he began, and stopped, for without so much as a glance at him,\\nmy lady ran towards the prisoner, crying:\\n\\n\"Harry! Oh, Harry!\"\\n\\nJack gathered that he was the person addressed, and instantly made her\\nan elaborate leg.\\n\\nThe next moment she was tugging at the lapels of his coat, with her face\\nupturned to his.\\n\\n\"Harry, you WICKED boy!\" she cried, and added beneath her breath: \"My\\nname is Molly!\"\\n\\nA laugh sprang to my lord\\'s eyes and his beautiful smile appeared.\\n\\nIn a stupefied fashion O\\'Hara watched him steal an arm about her waist,\\nand place a hand beneath her chin. The next instant a kiss was planted\\nfull on the little lady\\'s lips, and he heard Jack Carstares\\' voice\\nexclaim:\\n\\n\"Fie on you, Molly, for a spoil-sport! Here had I fooled Miles to the\\ntop of my bent--and \\'pon rep.! he scarce knows me yet!\"\\n\\nMy lady disengaged herself, blushing.\\n\\n\"Oh, Miles, you do know Harry--my cousin Harry?\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara collected his scattered wits and rose nobly to the occasion.\\n\\n\"Of course I do, me dear, though at first he gave me such a shock, I was\\nnear dumbfounded. Ye are a mad, scatter-brained fellow to play such a\\nthrick upon us, devil take ye!\" He laid his hands on Jack\\'s shoulders.\\n\"Pray, what did ye do it for, boy?\"\\n\\nJack\\'s brain worked swiftly.\\n\\n\"Why, Miles, never tell me you\\'ve forgot our wager! Did I not swear I\\'d\\nhave you at a disadvantage--to be even with you for that night at\\nJasper\\'s? But what must you do but see my pistol was unloaded and make\\nme lose my wager! Still, \\'twas worth that and a night in gaol to see\\nyour face when I unmasked!\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara shook him slightly, laughing, and turned to the two amazed\\ngaolers. The senior gaoler met his humorous glance with a cold and\\nindignant stare, and gave a prodigious sniff.\\n\\n\"Me good fellows,\" drawled Miles, \"I\\'m mighty sorry ye\\'ve been worried\\nover me young cousin here. He\\'s fooled us all it appears, but now\\nthere\\'s nought to be done in the matter, though I\\'ve a mind to send him\\nto await the next sessions!\" He slipped a guinea into each curiously\\nready palm, and replied to the head gaoler\\'s haughty bow with a pleasant\\nnod. In silence he watched them leave the room shaking their heads over\\nthe incomprehensible ways of the gentry. Then he turned and looked\\nacross at Carstares.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\nLADY O\\'HARA RETIRES\\n\\n\\nFor a long minute silence reigned, all three actors in the little comedy\\nlistening to the heavy footsteps retreating down the passage, Carstares\\nwith one arm still around my lady\\'s waist and a rather strained look on\\nhis face. Molly instinctively felt that something beyond her ken was in\\nthe air, and glanced fearfully up at the white face above her. The\\nexpression in the blue eyes fixed on her husband made her turn sharply\\nto look at him. She found that he was staring at my lord as though he\\nsaw a ghost: She wanted to speak, to relieve the tension, but all words\\nstuck in her throat, and she could only watch the _denouement_\\nbreathlessly. At last O\\'Hara moved, coming slowly towards them, reading\\nJohn\\'s countenance. Some of the wonder went out of his face, and, as if\\nhe sensed the other\\'s agony of mind, he smiled suddenly and laid his\\nhands once more on the straight, stiff shoulders.\\n\\n\"Jack, ye rascal, what do ye mean by hugging and kissing me wife under\\nme very eyes?\"\\n\\nMolly all at once remembered the position of her \"Cousin Harry\\'s\" arm,\\nand gave a little gasp, whisking herself away.\\n\\nMy lord put out his hands and strove to thrust his friend off.\\n\\n\"Miles, don\\'t forget--don\\'t forget--what I am!\"\\n\\nThe words were forced out, but his head was held high.\\n\\n\"Tare an\\' ouns, man! And is it meself that\\'ll be caring what ye may or\\nmay not be? Oh, Jack, Jack, I\\'m so pleased to see ye, that I can scarce\\nrealise \\'tis yourself I am looking at! When did ye come to England, and\\nwhat-a-plague are you doing in that costume?\" He jerked his head to\\nwhere John\\'s mask lay, and wrung the hand he held as though he would\\nnever stop.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been in England a year. As to the mask--!\" He shrugged and\\nlaughed.\\n\\nLady O\\'Hara pushed in between them.\\n\\n\"But please I do not understand!\" she said plaintively.\\n\\nCarstares bowed over her hand.\\n\\n\"May I be permitted to thank you for your kindly intervention, my lady?\\nAnd to congratulate Miles on his marriage?\"\\n\\nShe dimpled charmingly and curtsied. Her husband caught her round the\\nwaist.\\n\\n\"Ay, the saucy minx! Oh, me cousin Harry, forsooth! If it had been\\nanyone but Jack I should be angry with ye, asthore, for \\'twas a wicked\\nthrick to play entirely!\"\\n\\nShe patted his hand and smiled across at Jack.\\n\\n\"Of course, I would never have done such a forward thing had I not known\\nthat he was indeed a gentleman--and had he not saved me from sudden\\ndeath!\" she added as an afterthought.\\n\\nMiles looked sharply round at her and then at Carstares.\\n\\n\"What\\'s this?\"\\n\\n\"My lady exaggerates,\" smiled my lord. \"\\'Tis merely that I had the\\nhonour to catch her as she fell down the steps this morning.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara looked relieved.\\n\\n\"Ye are not hurt, alanna?\"\\n\\n\"Gracious, no! But I had to do something to show my gratitude--and I was\\nsure that you would never expose _my_ fraud--so I--But,\" as a sudden\\nthought struck her, \"you seem to _know_ my highwayman!\"\\n\\n\"Sure an\\' I do, Molly. \\'Tis none other than Jack Carstares of whom ye\\'ve\\noften heard me speak!\"\\n\\nShe turned round eyes of wonderment upon my lord.\\n\\n\"Can it be--is it possible that you are my husband\\'s dearest\\nfriend--Lord John?\"\\n\\nJack flushed and bowed.\\n\\n\"I was once--madam,\" he said stiffly.\\n\\n\"Once!\" she scoffed. \"Oh, if you could but hear him speak of you! But\\nI\\'ll let you hear him speak _to_ you, which perhaps you\\'ll enjoy more. I\\nknow you\\'ve a prodigious great deal to say to one another, so I shall\\nrun away and leave you alone.\" She smiled graciously upon him, blew an\\nairy kiss to her husband and went quickly out of the room.\\n\\nCarstares closed the door behind her and came back to O\\'Hara, who had\\nflung himself back into his chair, trying, manlike, to conceal the\\nexcitement he was feeling.\\n\\n\"Come, sit ye down, Jack, and let me have the whole story!\"\\n\\nMy lord divested himself of his long cloak and shook out his hitherto\\ntucked-up ruffles. From the pocket of his elegant scarlet riding coat he\\ndrew a snuff-box, which he opened languidly. With his eyes resting\\nquizzically on O\\'Hara\\'s face, he took a delicate pinch of snuff and\\nminced across the room.\\n\\nMiles laughed.\\n\\n\"What\\'s this?\"\\n\\n\"This, my dear friend, is Sir Anthony Ferndale, Bart.!\" He bowed with\\ngreat flourish.\\n\\n\"Ye look it. But come over here, Sir Anthony Ferndale, Bart., and tell\\nme everything.\"\\n\\nJack perched on the edge of the desk and swung his leg.\\n\\n\"Well really, I do not think there is much to tell that you do not\\nalready know, Miles. You know all about Dare\\'s card-party, for instance,\\nprecisely six years ago?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis just exactly what I do not know!\" retorted O\\'Hara.\\n\\n\"You surprise me! I thought the tale was rife.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Jack, will ye have done drawling at me? Don\\'t be forgetting I\\'m\\nyour friend--\"\\n\\n\"But are you? If you know the truth about me, do you feel inclined to\\ncall me friend?\"\\n\\n\"There never was a time when I would not have been proud to call ye\\nfriend, as ye would very well have known, had ye been aught but a damned\\nyoung hothead! I heard that crazy tale about the card-party, but do ye\\nthink I believed it?\"\\n\\n\"It was the obvious thing to do.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe, but I fancy I know ye just a little too well to believe any\\ncock-and-bull story I\\'m told about ye. And even if I had been fool\\nenough to have believed it, do ye think I\\'d be going back on ye? Sure,\\n\\'tis a poor friend I\\'d be!\"\\n\\nJack stared down at the toe of his right boot in silence.\\n\\n\"I know something more than we guessed happened at that same party, and\\nI have me suspicions, but \\'tis your affair, and whatever ye did ye had\\nyour reasons for. But, Jack, why in the name of wonder must ye fly off\\nto the devil alone knows where, without so much as a good-bye to\\nanyone?\"\\n\\nCarstares never raised his eyes from the contemplation of that boot. He\\nspoke with difficulty.\\n\\n\"Miles--in my place--would you not have done the same?\"\\n\\n\"Well--\"\\n\\n\"You know you would. Was it likely that I should inflict myself on you\\nat such a time? What would you have thought of me had I done so?\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara brought his hand down smartly on the other\\'s knee.\\n\\n\"I\\'d have thought ye less of a young fool! I would have gone away with\\nye, and nothing would have stopped me!\"\\n\\nJack looked up and met his eyes.\\n\\n\"I know,\" he said. \"\\'Twas the thought of that--and--and--I could not be\\nsure. How should I know whether you would even receive me? Last\\nnight--last night--I was horribly afraid....\"\\n\\nThe hand on his knee tightened.\\n\\n\"Ye foolish boy! Ye foolish boy!\"\\n\\nBit by bit he drew the story of the past six years out of Carstares, and\\nthough it was a very modified version, Miles understood his friend well\\nenough to read between the lines.\\n\\n\"And now,\" said Jack, when the recital was over, \"tell me about\\nyourself. When did you marry the attractive lady whom I have just been\\nkissing?\"\\n\\n\"Ye rogue! I married Molly three years ago. \\'Tis a real darling she is,\\nisn\\'t she? And upstairs there\\'s a little chap--your godson.\"\\n\\n\"You lucky fellow! My godson, you say? Could you not find anyone more\\nworthy for that? I want to see him.\"\\n\\n\"So ye shall presently. Have ye seen Richard?\"\\n\\n\"A year ago I held up his coach. \\'Twas dark, and I could scarce see him,\\nbut I thought he seemed aged.\"\\n\\n\"Aged! Ye wouldn\\'t be afther knowing him! \\'Tis an old man he is. Though\\nI swear \\'tis no wonder with that hussy about the house! Lord, Jack, you\\nwere well out of that affair with her ladyship!\"\\n\\nCarstares nursed his foot reflectively.\\n\\n\"Lavinia? What ails her?\"\\n\\n\"Nought that I know of, save it be her shrewish temper. \\'Tis a dog\\'s\\nlife she leads poor Dick.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean to say she does not love Dick?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot say--sometimes she\\'s as affectionate as you please, but at\\nothers she treats him to a fine exhibition of rage. And the money she\\nspends! Of course, she married him for what she could get. There was\\nnever anything else to count with her.\"\\n\\nJack sat very still.\\n\\n\"And anyone but a young fool like yourself would have seen that!\"\\n\\nA gleam of amusement shot into the wistful blue eyes.\\n\\n\"Probably. Yourself, for instance?\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara chuckled.\\n\\n\"Oh, ay, I knew! \\'Twas the money she was after all along; and now\\nthere\\'s not so much, it seems, as Dick won\\'t touch a penny that belongs\\nto you.\"\\n\\n\"M\\'m. Warburton told me. Foolish of him.\"\\n\\nA grunt was the sole response.\\n\\nJack\\'s eyes narrowed a little as he gazed out of the window. \"So Lavinia\\nnever cared? Lord, what a mix-up! And Dick?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid he still does.\"\\n\\n\"Poor old Dick! Devil take the woman! Does she bully him? I know what he\\nis--always ready to give in.\"\\n\\n\"I am not so sure. Yet I\\'ll swear if \\'twere not for John his life would\\nbe a misery. He misses you, Jack.\"\\n\\n\"Who is John?\"\\n\\n\"Did not Warburton tell you? John is the hope of the house. He\\'s four\\nand a half, and as spoilt a little rascal as you could wish for.\"\\n\\n\"Dick\\'s child? Good Lord!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, Dick\\'s child and your nephew.\" He broke off and looked into the\\nother\\'s face. \"Jack, cannot this mystery be cleared up? Couldn\\'t ye go\\nback?\" He was clasping Jack\\'s hand, but it was withdrawn, and the eyes\\nlooking down into his were suddenly bored and a little cold.\\n\\n\"I know of no mystery,\" said Carstares.\\n\\n\"Jack, old man, will ye be afther shutting me out of your confidence?\"\\n\\nA faint, sweet smile curved the fine lips.\\n\\n\"Let us talk of the weather, Miles, or my mare. Anything rather than\\nthis painful subject.\"\\n\\nWith an impatient movement O\\'Hara flung back his chair and strode over\\nto the window with his back to my lord. Jack\\'s eyes followed him\\nseriously.\\n\\n\"If ye cannot trust me, sure I\\'ve no more to say, thin!\" flashed O\\'Hara.\\n\"It seems ye do not value your friends too highly!\"\\n\\nMy lord said never a word. But the hand that rested on the desk clenched\\nsuddenly. O\\'Hara wheeled about and came back to his side.\\n\\n\"Sure, Jack, I never meant that! Forgive me bad temper!\"\\n\\nCarstares slipped off the table and straightened himself, linking his\\narm in the Irishman\\'s.\\n\\n\"Whisht, Miles, as you\\'d say yourself,\" he laughed, \"I know that. \\'Tis\\nnot that I don\\'t trust you, but--\"\\n\\n\"I understand. I\\'ll not ask ye any more about it at all. Instead, answer\\nme this: what made ye come out with unloaded pistols?\"\\n\\nThe laugh died out of Carstares\\' face.\\n\\n\"Oh, just carelessness!\" he answered shortly, and he thought of the\\nabsent Jim with a tightening of the lips.\\n\\n\"\\'Twas that very same reason with meself thin!\" Jack stared at him.\\n\\n\"Miles, don\\'t tell me yours were unloaded, too?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Deed an\\' they were! Ecod, Jack! \\'tis the best joke I\\'ve heard for a\\ntwelvemonth.\" They both started to laugh. \"Sure \\'twas bluff on my part,\\nJack, when I told ye yours was unloaded. And me lady was determined to\\nset you free from the moment I told her all about it this morning. We\\nwere sure ye were no ordinary highwayman, though I was a fool not to\\nhave known ye right away. But now I have found ye out, ye\\'ll stay with\\nus--Cousin Harry?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot thank you enough, Miles, but I will not do that. I must get\\nback to Jim.\"\\n\\n\"And who the devil is Jim?\"\\n\\n\"My servant. He\\'ll be worried nigh to death over me. Nay, do not press\\nme, I could not stay here, Miles. You must see for yourself \\'tis\\nimpossible--Jack Carstares does not exist; only Anthony Ferndale is\\nleft.\"\\n\\n\"Jack, dear man, can I not--\"\\n\\n\"No, Miles, you can do nothing, though \\'tis like you to want to help,\\nand I do thank you. But--oh well! ... What about my mare?\"\\n\\n\"Plague take me if I\\'d not forgotten! Jack, that scoundrel of mine let\\nher strain her fetlock. I\\'m demmed sorry.\"\\n\\n\"Poor Jenny! I\\'ll swear she gave him an exciting ride, though.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be trying to buy her off ye, Jack, if I see much of her. \\'Tis a\\nlittle beauty she is.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not selling, though I intended to ask you to keep her, if--\"\\n\\nA quick pressure on his arm arrested him.\\n\\n\"That will do! I\\'m too heavy for her anyway.\"\\n\\n\"So was that devil of a groom you put on her.\"\\n\\n\"Ay. I\\'m a fool.\"\\n\\n\"I always knew that.\"\\n\\n\"Whisht now, Jack! Ye\\'ll have to take one of my nags while she heals, if\\nye won\\'t stay with us. Can ye trust her to me for a week, do ye\\nsuppose?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. It seems as though I must--oh, I retract, I retract. You\\nare altogether too large, the day is too hot, and my cravat too nicely\\ntied--Egad, Miles! I wish--oh, I _wish_ we were boys again, and--Yes.\\nWhen may I see your son and heir?\"\\n\\n\"Sure, ye may come now and find Molly, who\\'ll be aching for the sight of\\nyou. Afther you, Sir Anthony Ferndale, Bart!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI\\n\\nMY LORD TURNS RESCUER AND COMES NIGH ENDING HIS LIFE\\n\\n\\nLate that afternoon Carstares left Thurze House on one of his friend\\'s\\nhorses. He waved a very regretful farewell to O\\'Hara and his lady,\\npromising to let them know his whereabouts and to visit them again soon.\\nO\\'Hara had extracted a solemn promise that if ever he got into\\ndifficulties he would let him know:\\n\\n\"For I\\'m not letting ye drift gaily out of me life again, and that\\'s\\nflat.\"\\n\\nJack had assented gladly enough--to have a friend once more was such\\nbliss--and had given Miles the name of the inn and the village where he\\nwould find him, for O\\'Hara had insisted on bringing the mare over\\nhimself. So Carstares rode off to Trencham and to Jim, with the memory\\nof a very hearty handshake in his mind. He smiled a little as he thought\\nof his friend\\'s words when he had shown himself reluctant to give the\\nrequired promise:\\n\\n\"Ye obstinate young devil, ye\\'ll do as I say, and no nonsense, or ye\\ndon\\'t leave this house!\"\\n\\nFor six years no one had ordered him to obey; it had been he who had\\ndone all the ordering. Somehow it was very pleasant to be told what to\\ndo, especially by Miles.\\n\\nHe turned down a lane and wondered what Jim was thinking. That he was\\nwaiting at the Green Man, he was certain, for those had been his orders.\\nHe was annoyed with the man over the incident of the pistols, for he had\\ninspected them and discovered that they were indeed unloaded. Had his\\ncaptor been other than O\\'Hara, on whom he could not fire, such\\ncarelessness might have proved his undoing. Apart from that, culpable\\nnegligence always roused his wrath. A rather warm twenty minutes was in\\nstore for Salter.\\n\\nFor quite an hour Carstares proceeded on his way with no mishaps nor\\nadventures, and then, suddenly, as he rounded a corner of a deserted\\nroad--little more than a cart-track--an extraordinary sight met his\\neyes. In the middle of the road stood a coach, and by it, covering the\\nmen on the box with two large pistols, was a seedy-looking ruffian,\\nwhile two others were engaged in what appeared to be a life-and-death\\nstruggle at the coach-door.\\n\\nJacked reined-in his horse and rose in his stirrups to obtain a better\\nview. Then his eyes flashed, and he whistled softly to himself. For the\\ncause of all the turmoil was a slight, graceful girl of not more than\\nnineteen or twenty. She was frenziedly resisting the efforts of her\\ncaptors to drag her to another coach, further up the road. Jack could\\nsee that she was dark and very lovely.\\n\\nAnother, elderly lady, was most valiantly impeding operations by clawing\\nand striking at one of the men\\'s arms, scolding and imploring all in one\\nbreath. Jack\\'s gaze went from her to a still, silent figure at the side\\nof the road in the shadow of the hedge, evidently the stage-manager. \"It\\nseems I must take a hand in this,\" he told himself, and laughed joyously\\nas he fixed on his mask and dismounted. He tethered his mount to a young\\nsapling, took a pistol from its holster, and ran softly and swiftly\\nunder the lea of the hedge up to the scene of disaster, just as the man\\nwho covered the unruly and vociferous pair on the box made ready to\\nfire.\\n\\nJack\\'s bullet took him neatly in the neck, and without a sound he\\ncrumpled up, one of his pistols exploding harmlessly as it fell to\\nearth.\\n\\nWith an oath the silent onlooker wheeled round to face the point of my\\nlord\\'s gleaming blade.\\n\\nCarstares drew in his breath sharply in surprise as he saw the white\\nface of his Grace of Andover.\\n\\n\"Damn you!\" said Tracy calmly, and sprang back, whipping out his own\\nrapier.\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" agreed Jack pleasantly. \"On guard, M. le Duc!\"\\n\\nTracy\\'s lips curled back in a snarl. His eyes were almost shut. Over his\\nshoulder he ordered curtly:\\n\\n\"Keep watch over the girl. I will attend to this young jackanapes.\"\\n\\nOn the word the blades clashed.\\n\\nJack\\'s eyes danced with the sheer joy of battle, and his point snicked\\nin and out wickedly. He knew Tracy of old for an expert swordsman, and\\nhe began warily.\\n\\nThe girl\\'s persecutors retained a firm hold on either arm, but all their\\nthoughts were centred on the duel. The men on the box got out their\\nblunderbuss, ready to fire should the need arise, and the girl herself\\nwatched breathlessly, red lips apart, and eyes aglow with fright,\\nindignation, and excitement. As for the old lady, she positively bobbed\\nup and down shrieking encouragement to Carstares.\\n\\nThe blades hissed continuously against one another; time after time the\\nDuke thrust viciously, and ever his point was skilfully parried. He was\\nabsolutely calm, and his lips sneered. Who it was that he was fighting,\\nhe had not the faintest idea; he only knew that his opponent had\\nrecognised him, and must be speedily silenced. Therefore he fought with\\ndeadly grimness and purpose. Carstares, on the other hand, had no\\nintention of killing his Grace. He had never liked him in the old days,\\nbut he was far too good-natured to contemplate any serious bloodshed. He\\nwas so used to Tracy\\'s little affairs that he had not been filled with\\nsurprise when he discovered who the silent figure was. He did not like\\ninterfering with Belmanoir, but, on the other hand, he could no more\\nstand by and see a woman assaulted than he could fly. So he fought on\\nwith the idea of disarming his Grace, so as to have him at a\\ndisadvantage and to be able to command his withdrawal from the scene.\\nOnce he feinted cleverly, and lunged, and a little blood trickled down\\nover the Duke\\'s hand. No sign made Belmanoir, except that his eyelids\\nflickered a moment and his play became more careful.\\n\\nOnce the Duke thrust in tierce and Jack\\'s sword arm wavered an instant,\\nand a splash of crimson appeared on his sleeve. He, for the most part,\\nremained on the defensive, waiting for the Duke to tire. Soon his\\nGrace\\'s breath began to come unevenly and fast, and beads of moisture\\nstarted on his forehead. Yet never did the sneer fade nor his temper go;\\nhe had himself well in hand, and although his face was livid, and his\\nbrain on fire with fury, no trace of it showed itself in his sword-play.\\n\\nThen Carstares changed his tactics, and began to put into practice all\\nthe arts and subtleties of fence that he had learnt abroad. He seemed\\nmade of steel and set on wires, so agile and untireable was he. Time\\nafter time he leapt nimbly aside, evading some wicked thrust, and all\\nthe while he was driving his Grace back and back. He was not panting,\\nand now and again he laughed softly and happily. The blood from the\\nwound on his arm was dripping steadily on to the ground, yet it seemed\\nto Tracy to affect him not at all. But Jack himself knew that he was\\nlosing strength rapidly, and must make an end.\\n\\nSuddenly he feinted, and fell back. Tracy saw his advantage and pressed\\nforward within the wavering sword-point.\\n\\nThe next instant his sword was whirled from his grasp, and he lay on the\\nground, unhurt but helpless, gazing up at the masked face and at the\\nshortened rapier. How he had been thrown he did not know, but that his\\nopponent was a past master in the art of fence he was perfectly sure.\\n\\nMy lord gave a little chuckle and twisted a handkerchief about his\\nwounded arm.\\n\\n\"I am aware, m\\'sieur, that this is most unusual--and, in\\nduels--forbidden. But I am sure that milor\\' will agree that the\\ncircumstances are also--most unusual--and the odds--almost\\noverwhelming!\" He turned his head to the two men, one of whom released\\nhis hold on the girl\\'s arm and started forward.\\n\\n\"Oh, no!\" drawled my lord, shaking his head. \"Another step and I spit\\nyour master where he lies.\"\\n\\n\"Stand,\" said his Grace calmly.\\n\\n\"_Bien_! Throw your arms down here at my feet, and--ah--release\\nMademoiselle!\"\\n\\nThey made no move to obey, and my lord shrugged deprecatingly, lowering\\nhis point to Tracy\\'s throat.\\n\\n\"_Eh bien!_\"\\n\\nThey still hesitated, casting anxious glances at their master. \"Obey,\"\\nordered the Duke.\\n\\nEach man threw down a pistol, eyeing Jack furtively, while the girl ran\\nto her aunt, who began to soothe and fuss over her.\\n\\nJack stifled a yawn.\\n\\n\"It is not my intention to remain here all night. Neither am I a\\nchild--or a fool. _Dépêchez!_\"\\n\\nBelmanoir saw that the coachman had his blunderbuss ready and was only\\ntoo eager to fire it, and he knew that the game was up. He turned his\\nhead towards the reluctant bullies who looked to him for orders.\\n\\n\"Throw down everything!\" he advised.\\n\\nTwo more pistols and two daggers joined their comrades.\\n\\n\"A thousand thanks!\" bowed my lord, running a quick eye over the men.\\n\"M. le Duc, I pray you be still. Now, you with the large nose--yes, _mon\\nami_, you--go pick up the pistol our defunct friend dropped.\"\\n\\nThe man indicated slouched over to the dead body and flung another\\npistol on to the heap.\\n\\nMy lord shook his head impatiently.\\n\\n\"_Mais non_. Have I not said that I am not entirely a fool? The\\nunexploded pistol, please. You will place it here, _doucement._ Very\\ngood.\"\\n\\nHis eye travelled to the men on the box. The coachman touched his hat\\nand cried:\\n\\n\"I\\'m ready, sir!\"\\n\\n\"It is very well. Be so good as to keep these gentlemen covered, but do\\nnot fire until I give the order. And now, M. le Duc, have I your parole\\nthat you will return swiftly from whence you came, leaving this lady\\nunmolested, an I permit you to rise?\"\\n\\nTracy moved his head impatiently.\\n\\n\"I have no choice.\"\\n\\n\"Monsieur, that is not an answer. Have I your parole?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, curse you!\"\\n\\n\"But certainly,\" said Jack politely. \"Pray rise.\"\\n\\nHe rested his sword-point on the ground, and watched Tracy struggle to\\nhis feet.\\n\\nFor an instant the Duke stood staring at him, with face slightly\\nout-thrust.\\n\\n\"I almost think I know you,\" he said softly, caressingly.\\n\\nJack\\'s French accent became a shade more pronounced.\\n\\n\"It is possible. I at least have the misfortune to know monsieur by\\nsight.\"\\n\\nTracy ignored the insult, and continued very, very silkily:\\n\\n\"One thing is certain: I shall know you again--if I meet you!\"\\n\\nEven as the words left his mouth Jack saw the pistol in his hand and\\nsprang quickly to one side, just in time to escape a shot that would\\nhave gone straight through his head. As it was, it caught him in his\\nleft shoulder.\\n\\n\"Do not fire!\" he called sharply to the coachman, and bowed to his\\nGrace. \"As I was saying, m\\'sieu--do not let me detain you, I beg.\"\\n\\nThe Duke\\'s green eyes flashed venom for a minute, and then the heavy\\nlids descended over them again, and he returned the bow exaggeratedly.\\n\\n\"_Au revoir_, monsieur,\" he smiled, and bent to pick up his sword.\\n\\n\"It will--not be necessary for--m\\'sieu to--take his sword,\" said Jack.\\n\"I have a--desire to keep--it as a--souvenir. Yes.\"\\n\\n\"As you will, monsieur,\" replied Tracy carelessly, and walked away to\\nhis coach, his men following close on his heels.\\n\\nMy lord stood leaning heavily on his sword, watching them go, and not\\nuntil the coach had swung out of sight did he give way to the weakness\\nthat was overwhelming him. Then he reeled and would have fallen, had it\\nnot been for two cool hands that caught his, steadying him.\\n\\nA tremulous, husky voice sounded in his ears:\\n\\n\"You are hurt! Ah, sir, you are hurt for my sake!\"\\n\\nWith a great effort Jack controlled the inclination to swoon, and lifted\\nthe girl\\'s hand shakily to his lips.\\n\\n\"It is a--pleasure--mademoiselle,\" he managed to gasp. \"Now--you may--I\\nthink--proceed--in safety.\"\\n\\nDiana slipped an arm under his shoulder and cast an anxious glance at\\nthe footman, hurrying towards them.\\n\\n\"Quick!\" she commanded. \"Sir, you are faint! You must allow my servant\\nto assist you to the coach.\"\\n\\nJack forced a smile.\\n\\n\"It is--nothing--I assure you--pray do not--I--\" and he fainted\\ncomfortably away into stout Thomas\\'s arms.\\n\\n\"Carry him into the coach, Thomas!\" ordered the girl. \"Mind his arm,\\nand--oh! his poor shoulder. Aunt, have you something to bind his wounds\\nwith?\"\\n\\nMiss Betty hurried forward.\\n\\n\"My darling child, what an escape! The dear, brave gentleman! Do have a\\ncare, Thomas! Yes, lay him on the seat.\"\\n\\nMy lord was lowered gently on to the cushions, and Miss Betty fluttered\\nover to him like a distracted hen. Then Diana told Thomas to take charge\\nof my lord\\'s horse that they could see, quietly nibbling the grass\\nfurther down the road, stooped and picked up his Grace of Andover\\'s\\nsword, with its curiously wrought hilt, and jumped into the coach to\\nhelp Miss Betty to attend to Jack\\'s wounds.\\n\\nThe slash on the arm was not serious, but where the pistol had taken him\\nwas very ugly-looking. While she saw to that, Miss Betty loosened the\\ncravat and removed my lord\\'s mask.\\n\\n\"Di, see what a handsome boy \\'tis! The poor, brave gentleman! What a\\nlucky thing he came up! If only this bleeding would stop!\" So she ran\\non, hunting wildly for her salts.\\n\\nDiana looked up as her aunt finished, and studied the pale face lying\\nagainst the dark cushions. She noted the firm, beautifully curved mouth,\\nthe aristocratic nose and delicately pencilled eyebrows, with a little\\nthrill. The duel had set her every nerve tingling; she was filled with\\nadmiration for her preserver, and the sight of his sensitive, handsome\\ncountenance did nothing to dispel that admiration.\\n\\nShe held the salts to his nostrils and watched eagerly for some sign of\\nlife. But none was forthcoming, and she had to be content with placing\\ncushions beneath his injured shoulder, and guarding him as best she\\nmight from the jolts caused by the uneven surface of the road.\\n\\nMiss Betty bustled about and did all she could to stanch the bleeding,\\nand when they had comfortably settled my lord, she sat down upon the\\nseat opposite and nodded decisively.\\n\\n\"We can do no more, my dear--but, yes--certainly bathe his forehead with\\nyour lavender water. Dear me, what an escape! I must say I would never\\nhave thought it of Mr. Everard! One would say we were living in the\\nStone Age! The wretch!\"\\n\\nDiana shuddered.\\n\\n\"I knew he was dreadful, but never _how_ dreadful! How can he have found\\nout when we were to leave Bath--and why did he waylay us so near home?\\nOh, I shall never be safe again!\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense, my dear! Fiddlesticks! You saw how easily he was vanquished.\\nDepend upon it, he will realise that he has made a bad mistake to try to\\nabduct you, and we shall not be worried with him again.\"\\n\\nWith this comfortable assurance, she nodded again and leant back against\\nthe cushions, watching her niece\\'s ministrations with a professional and\\nslightly amused air.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII\\n\\nMY LORD DICTATES A LETTER AND RECEIVES A VISITOR\\n\\n\\nMy lord came sighing back to life. He opened his eyes wearily, and\\nturned his head. A faint feeling of surprise stole over him. He was in a\\nroom he had never been in before, and by the window, busy with some\\nneedlework, sat a little old lady who was somehow vaguely familiar.\\n\\n\"Who--are--you?\" he asked, and was annoyed to find his voice so weak.\\n\\nThe little lady jumped, and came across to him.\\n\\n\"Praise be to God!\" she ejaculated. \"Likewise, bless the boy! The fever\\nis passed.\" She laid a thin hand on his brow, and smiled down into his\\nwondering eyes.\\n\\n\"As cool as a cucumber, dear boy. What a mercy!\"\\n\\nIt was a long time since anyone had called Jack dear, or boy. He\\nreturned the smile feebly and closed his eyes.\\n\\n\"I--do not--understand--anything,\" he murmured drowsily.\\n\\n\"Never trouble your head then. Just go to sleep.\"\\n\\nHe considered this gravely for a moment. It seemed sensible enough, and\\nhe was so very, very tired. He shut his eyes with a little sigh.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nWhen he awoke again it was morning of the next day, and the sun streamed\\nin the window, making him blink.\\n\\nSomeone rustled forward, and he saw it was the lady who had called him\\ndear and bidden him go to sleep.\\n\\nHe smiled, and a very thin hand came out of the bedclothes.\\n\\n\"But who are you?\" he demanded a little querulously.\\n\\nMiss Betty patted his hand gently.\\n\\n\"Still worrying your poor head over that? I am Di\\'s Aunt Betty--though,\\nto be sure, you don\\'t know who Di is!\"\\n\\nRemembrance was coming back to my lord.\\n\\n\"Why--why--you are the lady in the coach!--Tracy--I remember!\"\\n\\n\"Well, I know nought of Tracy, but I\\'m the lady in the coach.\"\\n\\n\"And the other--\"\\n\\n\"That was Diana Beauleigh, my niece--the pet. You will see her when you\\nare better.\"\\n\\n\"But--but--where am I, madam?\"\\n\\n\"Now don\\'t get excited, dear boy!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m thirty!\" protested Jack with a wicked twinkle.\\n\\n\"I should not have thought it, but thirty\\'s a boy to me, in any case!\"\\nretorted Miss Betty, making him laugh. \"You are in Mr. Beauleigh\\'s\\nhouse--Di\\'s father, and my brother. And here you will stay until you are\\nquite recovered!\"\\n\\nJack raised himself on his elbow, grimacing at the pain the movement\\ncaused him.\\n\\n\"Egad, madam! have I been here long?\" he demanded.\\n\\nVery firmly was he pushed back on to his pillows.\\n\\n\"Will you be still? A nice thing \\'twould be if you were to aggravate\\nthat wound of yours! You will have been here a week to-morrow. Bless my\\nheart, what ails the boy?\" For Jack\\'s face took on an expression of\\nincredulous horror.\\n\\n\"A _week_, madam? Never say so!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis as true as I stand here. And a nice fright you have given us, what\\nwith nearly dying, and raving about your Dicks and your Jims!\"\\n\\nMy lord glanced up sharply.\\n\\n\"Oh! So I--talked?\"\\n\\n\"Talk? Well, yes, if you can call all that mixture of foreign jargon\\ntalking. Now you must be still and wait till the doctor comes again.\"\\n\\nFor a while Carstares lay in silence. He thought of Jim and smiled a\\nlittle. \"I could not have thought of a better punishment had I tried,\"\\nhe told himself, and then frowned. \"Poor fellow! He\\'ll be off his head\\nwith fright over me. Miss--er--Betty?\"\\n\\n\"Well, and are you not asleep yet?\"\\n\\n\"Asleep, Madam? Certainly not!\" he said with dignity. \"I must write a\\nletter.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Deed, an\\' you shall not!\"\\n\\n\"But I must! \\'Tis monstrous important, madam.\"\\n\\nShe shook her head resolutely.\\n\\n\"Not until Mr. Jameson gives permission,\" she said firmly.\\n\\nJack struggled up, biting his lip.\\n\\n\"Then I shall get up!\" he threatened.\\n\\nIn an instant she was by his side.\\n\\n\"No, no! Now lie down and be good!\"\\n\\n\"I will not lie down and be good!\"\\n\\n\"Then I shan\\'t let you touch a pen for weeks!\"\\n\\nJack became very masterful and frowned direfully upon her.\\n\\n\"Madam, I insist on being allowed to write that letter!\"\\n\\n\"Sir, I insist on your lying down!\"\\n\\nHe controlled a twitching lip.\\n\\n\"Woe betide you unless you bring me pen and paper, Miss Betty!\"\\n\\n\"But, dear boy, reflect! You could not use your arm.\"\\n\\n\"I will use it!\" replied Jack indomitably, but he sank back on to the\\npillows with his eyes closed and a tiny furrow of pain between his\\nstraight brows.\\n\\n\"I told you so!\" scolded Miss Betty, not without a note of triumph in\\nher voice, and proceeded to rearrange the disorderly coverlet.\\n\\nThe blue eyes opened wide, pleadingly.\\n\\n\"Madam, indeed \\'tis very important.\"\\n\\nShe could not withstand that look.\\n\\n\"Well,\" she compromised, \"I\\'ll not let you write yourself, that\\'s\\ncertain--but could you not dictate to me?\"\\n\\nJack brightened, and caught her hand to his lips.\\n\\n\"Miss Betty, you are an angel!\" he told her.\\n\\n\"Ah now, get along with you!\" She hurried away to fetch paper and ink.\\n\\nWhen she returned she found him plucking impatiently at the sheet, and\\nfrowning.\\n\\n\"I am ready,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Thank you, madam. \\'Tis very kind in you--\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\"\\n\\nHe laughed weakly.\\n\\n\"I want you to write to my servant, to bid him bring my baggage to the\\nnearest inn--\"\\n\\n\"That will I not! I shall tell him to bring it here.\"\\n\\n\"But, Miss Betty, I cannot possibly trespass upon--\"\\n\\n\"Will you have done? Trespass indeed!\"\\n\\n\"I perceive I shall be much put upon,\" sighed Jack, and watched her\\nlightning smile.\\n\\n\"You BOY! Will you dictate?\"\\n\\n\"Very well, ma\\'am. No, I have changed my mind. I\\'ll have it writ to a\\nfriend, please: \\'Dear Miles.... True to my promise.... I write to\\nyou.... In case ... you should be worried ... over my disappearance ...\\nbe it known ... that I am at\\'--pray, madam, where am I?\"\\n\\n\"Horton Manor, Littledean,\" she replied, writing it down.\\n\\n\"Thank you. \\'I had the misfortune to injure my shoulder in a--\"\\n\\n\"\\'And arm,\\'\" put in the scribe, inexorably.\\n\\n\"\\'And arm, in a fight ... and a certain very ... kind lady--\\'\"\\n\\n\"I refuse to write that rubbish! \\'One of the ladies whom I rescued--\\'\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens, madam, you\\'ve not put that?\" cried Jack horrified.\\n\\nShe smiled reassuringly.\\n\\n\"I have not. I have put: \\'My nurse is writing this for me.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Madam, you are of a teasing disposition,\" reproved my lord.\\n\"M--yes--\\'When you take Jenny--over to Trencham ... will you please tell\\nJim to bring my baggage ... here at once?\\' Have you that, Miss Betty?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Remember me to Lady ... Molly, I beg ... and accept my apologies ...\\nand thanks.\\'\" He paused. \"Will you sign it J.C., please, and address it\\nto Sir Miles O\\'Hara, Thurze House, Maltby?\"\\n\\n\"Sir Miles O\\'Hara! Is he your friend, Mr.--Mr.--I do not know your\\nname.\"\\n\\n\"Car--\" began Jack, and stopped, biting his lip. \"Carr,\" he continued\\nimperturbably, \"John Carr. Do you know O\\'Hara, Miss Betty?\"\\n\\n\"Me? No! Will he come to see you, do you think?\"\\n\\n\"If you let him in, madam!\"\\n\\n\"Gracious! Well, well! I\\'ll tell Thomas to ride over with this at once.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Betty, you are marvellously good. I vow I can never thank--\"\\n\\n\"Bless the boy! And what about yourself, pray? I shudder to think of\\nwhat might have happened to Di if you had not come up! \\'Tis we can never\\nthank you enough.\"\\n\\nJack reddened boyishly and uncomfortably.\\n\\n\"Indeed, you exaggerate--\"\\n\\n\"Tut, tut! Well, go to sleep, and never worry about anything till I\\nreturn. And you won\\'t try and get up?\"\\n\\nHe shook with laughter.\\n\\n\"I swear I will not! Even an you never return, I will lie here, wasting\\naway--\" But he spoke to space, for with a delighted laugh she had left\\nthe room.\\n\\nIt was not until late that afternoon that O\\'Hara arrived, and he was\\nconducted, after a brief conversation with Diana and her father, to my\\nlord\\'s room, where Miss Betty received him with her cheery smile and\\njerky curtsey.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll not excite Mr. Carr?\" she said, but was interrupted by my lord\\'s\\nvoice from within, weak but very gay.\\n\\n\"Come in, Miles, and never listen to Miss Betty! She is a tyrant and\\ndenies me my wig!\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara laughed in answer to Miss Betty\\'s quizzical smile, and strode\\nover to the bed. He gripped my lord\\'s thin hand and frowned down at him\\nwith an assumption of anger.\\n\\n\"Young good-for-nought! Could ye find nought better to do than to smash\\nyourself up and well-nigh drive your man crazy with fright?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, pshaw! Did you find Jim?\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara looked round and saw that Miss Betty had discreetly vanished. He\\nsat gingerly down on the edge of the bed.\\n\\n\"Ay. I took the mare over as soon as I had your letter--and a fine scare\\nyou gave me, Jack, I can tell you! She recognised him, and I accosted\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll swear you did not get much satisfaction from Jim!\" said my lord.\\n\"Did he look very foolish?\"\\n\\n\"To tell ye the truth, I thought the man was half daft, and wondered\\nwhether I\\'d been after making a mistake. But in the end I got him to\\nbelieve what I was trying to tell him, and he has taken the mare, and\\nwill bring your baggage along this evening. By the way, John, I told him\\nof our little meeting, and of your pistols being unloaded. He said \\'twas\\nhis fault, and ye never saw aught to touch his face! Put out was not the\\nword for it.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose so. Look here, Miles, this is a damned funny affair!\"\\n\\n\"What happened to you exactly?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis what I am about to tell you. After I had left you, I rode on quite\\nquietly for about an hour, and then came upon Miss Beauleigh\\'s coach\\nstopped by three blackguards who were trying to drag her to another\\ncoach belonging to the gentleman who conducted the affair. So, of\\ncourse, I dismounted, and went to see what was to be done.\"\\n\\n\"You _would_ be after poking your nose into what didn\\'t concern ye. Four\\nmen, and ye had the audacity to tackle them all? \\'Tis mad ye are\\nentirely!\"\\n\\n\"Of course, if you had been in my place you would have ridden off in\\nanother direction--or aided the scoundrels?\" was the scathing reply.\\n\\nO\\'Hara chuckled.\\n\\n\"Well, go on, Jack. I\\'m not saying I don\\'t wish I had been with ye.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twould have been superb. I suppose Miss Beauleigh has told you most of\\nthe tale, but there is one thing that she could not have told you, for\\nshe did not know it: the man I fought with was Belmanoir.\"\\n\\n\"Thunder and turf! Not the Duke?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Tracy.\"\\n\\n\"Zounds! Did he know ye?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot be certain. I was masked, of course, but he said he thought he\\ndid. \\'Twas at that moment he fired his pistol at me.\"\\n\\n\"The dirty scoundrel!\"\\n\\n\"M\\'m--yes. \\'Tis that which makes me think he did not know me. Damn it\\nall, Miles, even Tracy would not do a thing like that!\"\\n\\n\"Would he not? If ye ask me, I say that Tracy is game enough for any\\nkind of devilry.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear fellow, that is too black! He could not try to kill in\\ncold blood a man he had hunted with, and fenced with-and--and--no man\\ncould!\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara looked extremely sceptical.\\n\\n\"Because ye could not yourself, is not to say that a miserable spalpeen\\nlike Belmanoir could not.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe it of him. We were always quite friendly--if it had\\nbeen Robert now--But I am not going to believe it. And don\\'t say\\nanything to these people, O\\'Hara, because they do not know Devil. I\\ngather from what Miss Betty says, that he calls himself Everard. He met\\nthe girl--Diana--at Bath; you know his way. She\\'d none of him: hence the\\nabduction.\"\\n\\n\"Heavens, but \\'tis a foul mind the man\\'s got!\"\\n\\n\"Where women are concerned, yes. Otherwise--\\'tis not such a bad fellow,\\nMiles.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve no use for that kind of dirt myself, Jack.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know. I daresay we are none of us exactly saints.\" He\\nchanged the subject abruptly. \"How is Jenny?\"\\n\\n\"Rather off her feed; missing you, I expect. I left her with your man.\\nHe should be arriving soon, I should think. I don\\'t fancy he\\'ll waste\\nmuch time.\"\\n\\n\"Neither do I. Poor fellow, he must have worried terribly over his\\nworthless master.\"\\n\\n\"Sure, his face was as white as your own when I told him ye were\\nwounded!\"\\n\\nCarstares turned his head quickly.\\n\\n\"What\\'s this about my face? Just be so kind as to hand me that mirror,\\nMiles.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara laughed and obeyed, watching my lord\\'s close scrutiny of his\\ncountenance with some surprise.\\n\\n\"Interesting pallor, my dear friend, interesting pallor. Nevertheless, I\\nam glad that Jim is on his way.\" He met O\\'Hara\\'s eyes as he looked up,\\nand his lips quivered irrepressibly.\\n\\n\"You think me very vain, Miles?\"\\n\\n\"Is it a pose of yours, John? Is it Sir Anthony Ferndale, Bart?\"\\n\\n\"No. I believe it is myself. You see, when one has but one\\'s self to\\nlive for and think for--one makes the most of one\\'s self! Hence my\\nvanity. Take the mirror away, please--the sight of my countenance\\noffends me!\"\\n\\n\"Sure, ye are free with your orders, me lord!\" said O\\'Hara, putting the\\nglass down on the table. \"And, while I think of it--what might your name\\nbe now?\"\\n\\n\"John Carr--a slip of the tongue on my part, stopped in time. I hear my\\nmentor returning--and--Miles!\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"Come again!\"\\n\\n\"Come again! My dear boy, ye\\'ll be sick of the sight of me soon! I shall\\nbe here every day.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks! It will take a good deal to sicken me, I think.\" He bit his\\nlip, turning his head away as Miss Betty came into the room.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid that you ought to leave my patient now, Sir Miles,\" she\\nsaid. \"He has had enough excitement for one day, and should sleep.\" She\\nglanced at the averted head inquiringly. \"I doubt he is tired?\"\\n\\nJack turned and smiled at her.\\n\\n\"No, Miss Betty, I\\'m not. But I know you will refuse to believe me.\"\\n\\n\"My dear boy, do you know you have black lines beneath your eyes?\"\\n\\n\"More remarks about my face!\" he sighed, and glanced at O\\'Hara, who had\\nrisen.\\n\\n\"You are quite right, Miss Beauleigh, I must go. May I come again\\nto-morrow?\"\\n\\n\"Surely,\" she beamed. \"We shall be delighted to welcome you.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara bent over the bed.\\n\\n\"Then _au revoir_, Jack. My lady sent her love to her \\'Cousin\\nHarry\\'--the saucy puss!\"\\n\\n\"Did she? How prodigious kind of her, Miles! And you\\'ll give her mine,\\nand kiss her--\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\" said O\\'Hara with dangerous calm. \"I\\'ll kiss her what?\"\\n\\n\"Her hand for me!\" ended Carstares, bubbling over. \"Good-bye, and thank\\nyou--\"\\n\\n\"That will suffice!\" said Miles, cutting him short.\\n\\nHe bowed to Miss Betty and left the room.\\n\\nThe business-like little lady fluttered over to the bedside and\\nrearranged the pillows.\\n\\n\"Well, and are you satisfied?\"\\n\\n\"Madam, most extraordinarily so, I thank you. I shall be getting up\\nsoon.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m!\" was all she vouchsafed, and left him to his meditations.\\n\\nAs she had foreseen, he dozed a little, but his shoulder would not allow\\nhim to sleep. He lay in a semi-comatose condition, his eyes shut, and a\\ndeep furrow, telling of pain, between his brows.\\n\\nThe sound of a shutting door made him open his eyes; he turned his head\\nslightly and saw that Jim Salter was standing in the middle of the room\\nlooking at him anxiously.\\n\\nMy lord returned his gaze crossly, and Jim waited for the storm to\\nbreak.\\n\\nCarstares\\' heart melted, and he managed to smile.\\n\\n\"I\\'m monstrous glad to see you, Jim,\" he said.\\n\\n\"You--you can\\'t mean that, sir! \\'Twas I left your pistols unloaded.\"\\n\\n\"I know. Damned careless of you, but it\\'s the sort of thing I should do\\nmyself, after all.\"\\n\\nJim advanced to the bedside.\\n\\n\"Do you mean you forgive me, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Why, of course! I could not have fired on my best friend in any case.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, but that don\\'t make it any better.\"\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t, of course, and I was rather annoyed at the time--Oh, devil\\ntake you, Jim, don\\'t look at me like that! I\\'m not dead yet!\"\\n\\n\"If--if you had been killed, sir--\\'twould have been my fault.\"\\n\\n\"Rubbish! I\\'d a sword, hadn\\'t I? For heaven\\'s sake don\\'t worry about it\\nany more! Have you brought all my baggage?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. It shan\\'t occur again, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not. Jenny is well?\"\\n\\n\"Splendid, sir. Will you still trust me with your pistols, sir?\"\\n\\nCarstares groaned.\\n\\n\"Will you have done? \\'Twas an accident, and I have forgotten it. Here\\'s\\nmy hand on it!\" He grasped Jim\\'s as he spoke, and seemed to brush the\\nwhole subject aside.\\n\\n\"Have you disposed of that horrible coat you tried to make me wear the\\nother day?\"\\n\\n\"I gave it to the landlord, sir.\"\\n\\n\"I should have burned it, but perhaps he liked it.\"\\n\\n\"He did, sir. Will you try to go to sleep now?\"\\n\\n\"If you had a shoulder on fire and aching as mine does, you wouldn\\'t ask\\nsuch a ridiculous question,\" answered Jack snappishly.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry, sir. Is there aught I can do?\"\\n\\n\"You can change the bandages, if you like. These are prodigious hot and\\nuncomfortable.\"\\n\\nWithout another word Salter set about easing his master, and he was so\\npainstaking and so careful not to hurt the ugly wound, and his face\\nexpressed so much concern, that Carstares controlled a desire to swear\\nwhen he happened to touch a particularly tender spot, and at the end\\nrewarded him with a smile and a sigh of content.\\n\\n\"That is much better,\" he said. \"You have such a light touch, Jim.\"\\n\\nThe man\\'s face reddened with pleasure, but he said nothing, and walked\\naway to the window to draw the curtains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII\\n\\nMY LORD MAKES HIS BOW\\n\\n\\nAfter Jim\\'s arrival my lord recovered quickly, each day making great\\nprogress, much to the doctor\\'s satisfaction, who never tired of telling\\nMr. Beauleigh and Miss Betty that it was entirely owing to his treatment\\nthat the patient had recovered at all. As his idea of treatment mainly\\nconsisted of copiously bleeding John, which process Miss Betty very soon\\nput an end to, he and she had many arguments on the subject, in which he\\nwas completely routed. She held that Mr. Carr was well on the strength\\nof her nursing and his own constitution--and very probably she was\\nright. In any case, hardly a fortnight after O\\'Hara\\'s first visit, my\\nlord was standing before his mirror, surveying himself, with his head\\nspeculatively on one side and a worried look in his eyes. Salter watched\\nhim anxiously, knowing this to be a critical moment. His master was\\nsomewhat of an enigma to him; the important things in life never\\nappeared to affect him, but over a question of two cravats as opposed to\\neach other, or some equally trivial matter, he would become quite\\nharassed.\\n\\nAfter contemplating his appearance for several moments, Carstares\\nfrowned and looked over his shoulder.\\n\\n\"I have changed my mind, Jim. I will wear blue after all.\" Salter sighed\\ndespairingly.\\n\\n\"Ye look very well in what ye have on, sir,\" he grunted. Jack sat down\\nobstinately.\\n\\n\"I have conceived a dislike--nay, a veritable hatred--for puce. I will\\nwear blue.\"\\n\\n\"Now, sir, do ha\\' done changing your clothes! Ye\\'ll be tired out before\\never ye get downstairs, and ye know what the doctor said.\"\\n\\nMy lord consigned the doctor and his words of wisdom to a place of great\\nheat.\\n\\n\"Ay, sir, but--\"\\n\\n\"The doctor is a worthy individual, Jim, but he knows even less of the\\nart of dressing than you do. He does not understand the soul-agony of a\\nman who makes his first appearance in puce.\"\\n\\n\"But--\"\\n\\n\"The blue coat laced with gold.\"\\n\\n\"Sir--\"\\n\\n\"I order it! I insist; the blue coat or nought!\"\\n\\n\"Very well, sir.\" Resignedly Jim walked to the cupboard.\\n\\nWhen at length his lordship was dressed to his entire satisfaction it\\nwas midway through the hot June afternoon, and Miss Betty was tapping at\\nthe door, wishing to know whether Mr. Carr was coming down, or whether\\nhe was not.\\n\\nCarstares shifted his sling, and taking up his hat, moved just a little\\nshakily to the door.\\n\\nSalter opened it, and cast a triumphant glance at Miss Betty, as though\\nhe were showing off all my lord\\'s graces. He proffered an arm.\\n\\n\"Shall I help ye, sir?\"\\n\\nMiss Betty curtsied low.\\n\\n\"La, Mr. Carr!\"\\n\\nJohn bowed profoundly.\\n\\n\"Give ye good den, madam,\" he said. \"I am just about to descend. Thank\\nyou, Jim.\" He leaned heavily on the man\\'s arm.\\n\\nMiss Betty walked round him admiringly.\\n\\n\"Lud! \\'Tis mighty elegant, I vow! But I protest, I am shy!\"\\n\\n\"Egad, Miss Betty! and why?\"\\n\\n\"You are not so young as I imagined,\" she replied candidly.\\n\\n\"Bear in mind, madam, that I never sought to deceive you. I am an aged\\nman.\"\\n\\n\"Thirty!\" she scoffed, and went on ahead. \"Come, child, and mind the\\nfirst step!\"\\n\\nAt the bottom of the staircase stood Mr. Beauleigh, a man of medium\\nheight, thin-lipped and grey-eyed. He came forward with one hand\\noutstretched.\\n\\n\"I am delighted to see you so much better, sir. I trust your shoulder no\\nlonger pains you?\"\\n\\nMy lord pushed Jim gently to one side and placed his hand in Mr.\\nBeauleigh\\'s.\\n\\n\"I thank you, sir, it is almost well. But for Miss Betty, who, I fear,\\nhas the makings of a true tyrant, I should not wear this obnoxious\\nsling.\"\\n\\nMr. Beauleigh smiled a little.\\n\\n\"Ah, yes, she keeps us all in order, does Betty. Pray, will you not walk\\na little in the garden? There are chairs on the lawn--and here is my\\ndaughter.\"\\n\\nHe waved to the door, and Carstares, turning, beheld Diana.\\n\\nShe stood framed by the dark wood, gowned in amber silk, with old lace\\nfalling from her elbows and over the bosom of her dress. Her hair was\\ndark as night, with little tendrils curling over her broad, white brow.\\nOne rolling curl fell over her shoulder, the rest were gathered up under\\na small lace cap, which was secured by means of a riband passed beneath\\nher chin.\\n\\nJack gazed, and gazed again, and in her turn Diana studied him with wide\\nbrown eyes of almost childlike innocence. Then her lids fluttered and\\ncurling lashes veiled the glorious depths, as a slow blush mounted to\\nher cheeks.\\n\\nMy lord recovered his manners and made his most approved leg as her\\nfather presented him.\\n\\n\"My love, this is Mr. Carr--\"\\n\\nDiana sank into a curtsey.\\n\\n\"--and, Mr. Carr, this is my daughter, Diana.\"\\n\\n\"I am delighted to make Miss Beauleigh\\'s acquaintance,\" said John, and\\nraised her hand to his lips.\\n\\nThe delicate, tapering fingers trembled a little in his hold, and\\ntremulous lips parted in the shyest and most adorable smile that he had\\never seen.\\n\\n\"Indeed, sir, we are already acquainted. I am not like to forget my\\nrescuer.\"\\n\\n\"I am happy to think that I was able to be of some service to you,\\nmademoiselle. Believe me, it was an honour to fight in your cause.\" His\\neyes were on the fascinating dimple that played about her mouth.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis very kind of you to say so, sir. I fear we greatly incommoded\\nyou--and--\" She made a gesture towards his sling.\\n\\n\"That, mademoiselle, is less than nothing. All the obligation is on my\\nside.\"\\n\\nMiss Betty bustled forward.\\n\\n\"Now that will do! I never heard such a foolish set of compliments! You\\nare looking tired, Mr. Carr; come into the garden and rest.\"\\n\\nSalter stepped forward, but Diana stayed him with uplifted finger.\\n\\n\"If Mr. Carr will accept my arm?\" she hazarded.\\n\\nJack flushed.\\n\\n\"Indeed, no, Miss Beauleigh--I can--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, tut-tut!\" cried Miss Betty. \"Have done dilly-dallying! Take him\\nout, Di!\"\\n\\nMr. Beauleigh had already disappeared. His world lay in his library, and\\nhe was never far from it for any length of time. Now he had seized the\\nmoment when his sister was not looking to withdraw quietly, and, when\\nshe turned round, she was only in time to see the library door close\\nsoftly.\\n\\n\"Your papa has gone again,\" she remarked to her niece. \"What a trying\\nman he is, to be sure!\"\\n\\nShe followed the pair out on to the lawn, and helped to make Carstares\\nseat himself in a long chair under a great elm. A cushion was placed\\nunder his wounded shoulder and another at his back.\\n\\n\"And are you sure that you are quite comfortable?\" inquired Miss Betty,\\nanxiously bending over him.\\n\\nJack laughed up at her.\\n\\n\"Quite sure, thank you, madam. But where will you sit?\"\\n\\n\"I shall sit in this chair, and Di will sit on a cushion\"--throwing one\\ndown--\"at my feet--so.\"\\n\\n\"I see that you are all ruled with a rod of iron, mademoiselle,\" he\\nsaid, and watched the dimple tremble into being.\\n\\n\"Indeed, yes, sir. \\'Tis very sad.\"\\n\\nMiss Betty chuckled, and unrolled a packet of silks which she threw into\\nher niece\\'s lap.\\n\\n\"Will you have the goodness to sort those for me, love?\" she asked,\\ntaking out her embroidery.\\n\\n\"Pray allow me to assist!\" pleaded John.\\n\\nDiana rose and planted her cushion down beside his chair. She then knelt\\ndown upon it and emptied the multi-coloured strands on to his knee.\\n\\n\"Very well! You must be very careful to separate the different pinks,\\nthough. See, we will have the rose here, the salmon here, the deeper\\nrose here, the pale pink over there, and the reds--there is no more\\nroom--we will put the reds in this paper.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" agreed Carstares. \"Are we to leave the other colours until\\nthe pinks are sorted?\"\\n\\nShe nodded and bent her head over the silks.\\n\\n\"Is Sir Miles coming this afternoon, Mr. Carr?\"\\n\\n\"Why yes, Miss Betty--now you mention it, I remember that he is. Miss\\nBeauleigh, I defy you to put that one on the rose pile; \\'tis a shade too\\ndeep.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure \\'tis not! Where is one to compare with it?\"\\n\\nCarstares produced a long thread and held it next to hers. The two heads\\nwere bent close over it. Diana sighed.\\n\\n\"You are right; I can just see the difference. But \\'tis _very_ slight!\"\\n\\nMiss Betty peeped over their shoulders.\\n\\n\"Gracious, what an eye you must have! I can detect no difference.\" Her\\neye ran along the row of silks laid out on my lord\\'s white satin leg.\\n\\n\"Mr. Carr,\" said Diana suddenly, \"I want to ask you something--something\\nthat has been puzzling me.\"\\n\\n\"Faith, what is it, Miss Beauleigh?\"\\n\\n\"Just this: why did you call Mr. Everard M. le Duc?\"\\n\\nThere was a tiny pause. My lord looked down into the gold-flecked eyes\\nand frowned a little.\\n\\n\"Did I call him that?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I remember it distinctly. Was it just--a manner of speaking?\"\\n\\n\"Just a manner of speaking.... You may call it that, mademoiselle. Do\\nyou not think that he looks rather ducal?\"\\n\\n\"I tried not to think of him at all. I hate him!\"\\n\\n\"Almost I begin to pity this Mr. Everard,\" quoth Jack.\\n\\nThe dimple peeped out.\\n\\n\"Then \\'tis most ungallant of you, sir!\" she reproved. \"Do you know Mr.\\nEverard?\"\\n\\n\"I have certainly seen him before, madam.\"\\n\\nDiana sat back on her heels and eyed him wonderingly.\\n\\n\"I believe you do not wish to answer me,\" she said slowly. \"Tell me, is\\n\\'Everard\\' that man\\'s real name?\"\\n\\nMy lord twisted the ring on his finger uneasily. He did not feel himself\\nat liberty to expose Belmanoir, and if he should reveal his true\\nidentity, it was quite possible that Mr. Beauleigh might seek him out,\\nin which case he himself might be recognised. He looked up.\\n\\n\"Pardon me, mademoiselle, but whence this cross-examination?\"\\n\\nDiana nodded placidly.\\n\\n\"I thought you would refuse, but I have discovered something that will\\nconfound you, sir!\" She rose to her feet. \"I will go and get it.\" She\\nwalked gracefully away towards the house, and my lord watched her go.\\n\\n\"Now _I_ am going to ask a question,\" broke in Miss Betty\\'s voice.\\n\\nHe threw out an imploring hand.\\n\\n\"Madam, I beg you will consider my feeble condition. Am I fit to bear\\nthe strain, think you?\"\\n\\n\"I do!--Is it usual for gentlemen to ride masked, as you were?\"\\n\\nAt that he laughed.\\n\\n\"No, madam, but for the gentlemen of the High Toby, it is _de régie_.\"\\n\\nShe paused, with her needle held in mid-air:\\n\\n\"Now, what mean you by that?\"\\n\\n\"Just that I am a common highwayman, Miss Betty.\"\\n\\nShe stared at him for a moment, and then resumed her work.\\n\\n\"You look it.\"\\n\\nJohn cast a startled glance down his slim person.\\n\\n\"Is that so, madam? And I rather flattered myself I did not!\"\\n\\n\"I was only laughing at you. You do not expect me to believe that\\nfabrication--surely?\"\\n\\n\"I fear I do,\" he sighed. \"\\'Tis very true, alack!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed? Also a friend of Sir Miles O\\'Hara, _J.P_.--and of Mr.\\nEverard?\"\\n\\n\"At least the last-named is not an acquaintance to be proud of,\" he\\nretorted.\\n\\n\"Perhaps not. My Di says he is some great gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"I perceive that your Di is by nature suspicious. Why does she think\\nthat?\"\\n\\n\"You will see. Di, love, here is Mr. Carr trying to make me believe that\\nhe is a highwayman!\"\\n\\nDiana came up to them smiling.\\n\\n\"I fear he teases you, aunt. Do you remember this, sir?\" Into Jack\\'s\\nhands she put his Grace of Andover\\'s sword.\\n\\nCarstares took it, surprised, and glanced casually at the hilt. Then he\\nstarted up.\\n\\n\"Why, \\'tis his sword. And I thought \\'twas left on the roadside. Can it\\nbe--did _you_ bring it, mademoiselle?\"\\n\\nShe dropped him a curtsey, and laughed.\\n\\n\"You are surprised, sir? You demanded the sword, so I naturally supposed\\nthat you required it. Therefore I brought it home.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twas monstrous thoughtful of you then. I dared not hope that it had not\\nbeen forgotten. I am very grateful--\"\\n\\n\"Then pray show your gratitude by sitting down again!\" advised the elder\\nMiss Beauleigh. \"Remember that this is your first day up, and have a\\ncare!\"\\n\\nJohn subsided obediently, turning the sword over in his hands.\\n\\nDiana pointed to the wrought gold hilt with an accusing finger.\\n\\n\"An I mistake not, sir, that is a coronet.\"\\n\\nMy lord\\'s eyes followed the pink-tipped finger and rested wrathfully\\nupon the arms of Andover. It was like Tracy to flaunt them on his\\nsword-hilt, he reflected.\\n\\n\"It certainly has that appearance,\" he admitted cautiously.\\n\\n\"Also, those are not paste, but real diamonds, and that is a ruby.\"\\n\\n\"I do not dispute it, madam,\" he answered meekly.\\n\\n\"And I believe that that big stone is an emerald.\"\\n\\n\"I am very much afraid that it is.\"\\n\\n\"An expensive toy!\" she said, and looked sharply at him.\\n\\n\"Ornate, I agree, but as true a piece of steel as ever I saw,\" replied\\nmy lord blandly, balancing the rapier on one finger.\\n\\n\"A very expensive toy!\" she repeated sternly.\\n\\nJohn sighed.\\n\\n\"True, madam--true.\" Then with a brightened air: \"Perhaps Mr. Everard\\nhas expensive tastes?\"\\n\\n\"It is very possible. And I think that Mr. Everard must have been more\\nthan a simple country gentleman to indulge those tastes.\"\\n\\nCarstares bit his lip to hide a smile at the thought of Tracy in the\\nlight of a simple country gentleman, and shook his head sadly.\\n\\n\"Do you infer that he came by this sword dishonestly, madam?\"\\n\\nThe dimple quivered and was gone.\\n\\n\"Sir, I believe that you are playing with me,\" she said with great\\ndignity.\\n\\n\"Madam, I am abashed.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad to hear it, then. I infer that Mr. Everard was something\\nmore than he pretended to be.\"\\n\\n\"In truth, a sorry rogue to deceive a lady.\"\\n\\n\"And I want to know if I am right. Is he, perhaps, some grand\\ngentleman?\"\\n\\n\"I can assure you, madam, that there is very little of the gentleman\\nabout Mr. Everard.\"\\n\\nMiss Betty began to laugh.\\n\\n\"Have done, my dear! \\'Tis of no avail, and \\'tis impolite to press Mr.\\nCarr too hard.\"\\n\\nDiana pouted.\\n\\n\"He is monstrous provoking, I think,\" she said, and eyed him\\nreproachfully.\\n\\n\"I am desolated,\" mourned Jack, but his eyes danced.\\n\\n\"And now you are laughing!\"\\n\\n\"But then, mademoiselle, so are you!\"\\n\\nShe shook her head, resolutely repressing the dimple.\\n\\n\"Then I am inconsolable.\"\\n\\nThe brown eyes sparkled and her lips parted in spite of her efforts to\\nkeep them in a stern line.\\n\\n\"Oh, but you are ridiculous!\" she cried, and sprang to her feet. \"And\\nhere is Sir Miles!\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara came across the lawn towards them, bowed to the ladies, and\\nglanced inquiringly from one to the other.\\n\\n\"Is it a joke ye have?\" he asked.\\n\\nDiana answered him.\\n\\n\"Indeed no, sir. \\'Tis Mr. Carr who is so provoking.\"\\n\\n\"Provoking, is it? And what has he been doing?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you the whole truth, Miles,\" interposed the maligned one.\\n\"\\'Tis Mistress Diana who is so inquisitive!\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" Diana blushed furiously \"I protest you are unkind, sir!\"\\n\\n\"Sure, \\'tis no gentleman he is, at all!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twas on the subject of gentlemen that we--\"\\n\\n\"Quarrelled,\" supplied her aunt.\\n\\n\"Disagreed,\" amended his lordship.\\n\\n\"Disagreed,\" nodded Diana. \"I asked him whether Mr. Everard was not some\\ngrand gentleman, and he evaded the point.\"\\n\\n\"I vow \\'tis slander!\" cried Jack. \"I merely said that Everard was no\\ngentleman at all.\"\\n\\n\"There! And was not that evading the point, Sir Miles?\"\\n\\n\"Was it? Sure, I\\'m inclined to agree with him.\"\\n\\n\"I declare you are both in league against me!\" she cried, with greater\\ntruth than she knew. \"I mean, was he perhaps a _titled_ gentleman?\"\\n\\n\"But how should Jack know that?\"\\n\\n\"Because I am sure he knows him--or, at least, of him.\"\\n\\n\"Listen, Mistress Di,\" broke in my lord, shooting a warning glance at\\nO\\'Hara. \"I will tell you all about Mr. Everard, and I hope you will be\\nsatisfied with my tale.\" He paused and seemed to cudgel his brain.\\n\"First he is, of course, titled--let me see--yes, he is a Duke. Oh, he\\nis certainly a Duke--and I am not sure but what he is royal--he--\"\\n\\n\"Now you are ridiculous!\" cried Miss Betty.\\n\\n\"You are very teasing,\" said Diana, and tried to frown. \"First you\\npretend to know nothing about Mr. Everard, and then you tell me foolish\\nstories about him. A Duke, indeed! I believe you _really_ do know\\nnothing about him!\"\\n\\nAs Carstares had hoped, she refused to believe the truth.\\n\\n\"He is playing with ye, child,\" said O\\'Hara, who had listened to Jack\\'s\\ntale with a face of wonder. \"I warrant he knows no Everard--eh, Jack?\"\\n\\n\"No, I cannot say that I do,\" laughed his lordship.\\n\\n\"But--but--you said--\"\\n\\n\"Never mind what he said, Miss Di. \\'Tis a scurvy fellow he is.\"\\n\\nShe regarded him gravely.\\n\\n\"Indeed, I almost think so.\"\\n\\nBut the dimple peeped out for all that! The next instant it was gone,\\nand Diana turned a face of gloom to her aunt, pouting her red lips\\nadorably, so thought my lord.\\n\\n\"Mr. Bettison,\" she said in accents of despair.\\n\\nAt these mystic words, Jack saw Miss Betty frown, and heard her\\nimpatient remark: \"Drat the man!\"\\n\\nHe looked towards the house, and perceived a short, rather stout, young\\nman to be walking with a peculiar strutting gait towards them. The boy\\nwas good-looking, Carstares acknowledged to himself, but his eyes were\\nset too close. And he did not like his style. No, certainly he did not\\nlike his style, nor the proprietary way in which he kissed Diana\\'s hand.\\n\\n\"How agreeable it is to see you again, Mr. Bettison!\" said Miss Betty\\nwith much affability. \"I declare \\'tis an age since we set eyes on you!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, Aunt,\" contradicted Diana sweetly. \"Why, it was only a very\\nshort while ago that Mr. Bettison was here, _surely_!\" She withdrew the\\nhand that the young man seemed inclined to hold fast to, and turned to\\nJohn.\\n\\n\"I think you do not know Mr. Bettison, Mr. Carr?\" she said. \"Mr.\\nBettison, allow me to present you to Mr. Carr. Sir Miles I think you\\nknow?\"\\n\\nThe squire bowed with a great deal of stiff hostility. Carstares\\nreturned the bow.\\n\\n\"You will excuse my not rising, I beg,\" he smiled. \"As you perceive--I\\nhave had an accident.\"\\n\\nLight dawned on Bettison. This was the man who had rescued Diana,\\nconfound his impudence!\\n\\n\"Ah, yes, sir! Your arm, was it not? My faith, I should be proud of such\\na wound!\"\\n\\nIt seemed to Carstares that he smiled at Diana in a damned familiar\\nfashion, devil take his impudence!\\n\\n\"It was indeed a great honour, sir. Mistress Di, I have finished sorting\\nyour green silks.\"\\n\\nDiana sank down on the cushion again, and shook some more strands out on\\nto his knee.\\n\\n\"How quick you have been! Now we will do the blue ones.\" Bettison\\nglared. This fellow seemed prodigious intimate with Diana, devil take\\nhim! He sat down beside Miss Betty, and addressed my lord patronisingly.\\n\\n\"Let me see--er--Mr. Carr. Have I met you in town, I wonder? At Tom\\'s,\\nperhaps?\"\\n\\nThis country bumpkin _would_ belong to Tom\\'s, reflected John savagely,\\nfor no reason at all. Aloud he said:\\n\\n\"I think it extremely unlikely, sir. I have been abroad some years.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed, sir? The \\'grand tour,\\' I suppose?\"\\n\\nMr. Bettison\\'s tone was not the tone of one who supposes any such thing.\\n\\nJohn smiled.\\n\\n\"Not this time,\" he said, \"that was seven years ago.\"\\n\\nMr. Bettison had heard rumours of this fellow who, it was murmured, was\\nnought but a common highwayman.\\n\\n\"Really? After Cambridge, perhaps?\"\\n\\n\"Oxford,\" corrected Carstares gently.\\n\\nCurse his audacity! thought Mr. Bettison.\\n\\n\"Seven years ago--let me think. George must have been on the tour\\nthen--Selwyn, I mean, Miss Beauleigh.\"\\n\\nJack, who had made the tour with several other young bucks fresh down\\nfrom college, accompanied as far as Paris by the famous wit himself,\\nheld his peace.\\n\\nMr. Bettison then launched forth into anecdotes of his own tour, and\\nseeing that his friend was entirely engrossed with Miss Diana and her\\nsilks, O\\'Hara felt it incumbent on him to draw the enemy\\'s fire, and,\\ntaking his own departure, to bear the squire off with him. For which he\\nreceived a grateful smile from my lord, and a kiss blown from the tips\\nof her fingers from Mistress Di, with whom he was on the best of terms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIV\\n\\nMISTRESS DIANA IS UNMAIDENLY\\n\\n\\nThe idyllic summer days passed quickly by, and every time that my lord\\nspoke of leaving, the outcry was so indignant and so firm that he\\nhastily subsided and told himself he would stay just another few days.\\nHis shoulder, having mended up to a certain point, refused quite to\\nheal, and exertion brought the pain back very swiftly. So his time was\\nfor the most part spent with Mistress Di out of doors, helping her with\\nher gardening and her chickens--for Diana was an enthusiastic poultry\\nfarmer on a small scale--and ministering to her various pets. If Fido\\nhad a splinter in his paw, it was to Mr. Carr that he was taken; if\\nNellie, the spaniel, caught a live rabbit, Mr. Carr would assuredly know\\nwhat to do for it, and the same with all the other animals. The young\\npair grew closer and closer together, while Miss Betty and O\\'Hara\\nwatched from afar, the former filled with pride of her darling, and\\nsatisfaction, and the latter with apprehension. O\\'Hara knew that his\\nfriend was falling unconsciously in love, and he feared the time when\\nJohn should realise it. He confided these fears to his wife, who, with\\nyoung David, was staying at her mother\\'s house in Kensington, in a long\\nand very Irish letter. She replied that he must try and coax my lord\\ninto coming to stay with them, when her charms would at once eclipse\\nMistress Diana\\'s, though to be sure, she could not understand why Miles\\nshould not wish him to fall in love, for as he well knew, \\'twas a\\nprodigious pleasant sensation. If he did not know it, then he was indeed\\nmost disagreeable. And had he ever heard of anything so\\nwonderful?--David had drawn a picture of a horse! Yes, really, it was a\\nhorse! Was he not a clever child? Further, would her dearest Miles\\nplease come and fetch her home, for although Mamma was prodigious\\namiable, and wanted her to stay several weeks, she positively could not\\nlive without her husband an instant longer than was necessary!\\n\\nAs soon as O\\'Hara read the last part of the letter he brushed Carstares\\nand his love affairs to one side, and posted straight to London to obey\\nthe welcome summons.\\n\\nBit by bit my lord discovered that he was very much in love with Diana.\\nAt first his heart gave a great bound, and then seemed to stop with a\\nsickening thud. He remembered that he could not ask her to marry him,\\ndisgraced as he was, and he immediately faced the situation, realising\\nthat he must go away at once. His first move was to Mr. Beauleigh, to\\ntell him of his decision. On being asked why he must so suddenly leave\\nHorton House, he explained that he loved Diana and could not in honour\\nspeak of love to her. At which Mr. Beauleigh gasped and demanded to know\\nthe reason. Carstares told him that he was by profession a highwayman,\\nand watched him bridle angrily. Before so agreeable and so smiling, Mr.\\nBeauleigh now became frigidly polite. He quite understood Mr. Carr\\'s\\nposition, and--er--yes, he honoured him for the course on which he had\\ndecided. But Mr. Beauleigh was very, very cold. Carstares gave Jim\\norders to pack immediately, that he might depart next day, and\\nreluctantly informed Miss Betty of his going. She was startled and\\nbewildered. She had imagined that he would spend all June with them.\\nCircumstances, he regretted, willed otherwise. He should always remember\\nher great kindness to him, and hoped that she would forgive the brusque\\nnature of his departure.\\n\\nWhen he told Diana her eyes opened very wide and she laughed, pointing\\nan accusing finger at him.\\n\\n\"You are teasing, Mr. Carr!\" she cried, and ran into the house.\\n\\nThat evening Miss Betty confirmed Jack\\'s words, and seeing the hurt look\\nin the girl\\'s eyes, wisely held her peace.\\n\\nNext morning in the pleasaunce Diana came across my lord, and went up to\\nhim, gravely questioning.\\n\\n\"You are really leaving us to-day, Mr. Carr?\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid I must, Mistress Di.\"\\n\\n\"So suddenly? Then you were not teasing yesterday?\"\\n\\n\"No, mademoiselle--I was not. I fear I have tarried too long, taking\\nadvantage of your kindness.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, no!\" she assured him. \"Indeed, you have not! Must you _really_\\ngo?\"\\n\\nLooking down into her big eyes, John read the answering love in them,\\nand grew pale. It was worse to think that she cared, too. If only he\\nthought she was indifferent, parting would not seem so unbearable.\\n\\n\"Mademoiselle--you overwhelm me--I must go.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, but I am sorry. Your being here has been such a pleasure! I--\" She\\nstopped, and looked away across the flowers.\\n\\n\"You?\" prompted Jack before he could check himself.\\n\\nWith a tiny laugh she brought her gaze back.\\n\\n\"I am sorry you must leave us, naturally.\"\\n\\nShe sat down beneath an arbour of roses, and patted the place beside her\\ninvitingly, with just the same unconscious friendliness that she had\\nalways shown him. My lord stayed where he was, with one hand on a tree\\ntrunk and the other fidgeting with his quizzing glass.\\n\\n\"Mistress Di--I think it only right that I should tell you what I have\\ntold your father, and what I told your aunt some time ago, when she\\nrefused to believe me. To some extent I am here under false pretences. I\\nam not what you think me.\"\\n\\nDiana laced and unlaced her fingers, and thought that she understood.\\n\\n\"Oh, no, Mr. Carr!\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid yes, mademoiselle. I am--a common felon ... a highwayman!\"\\nHe bit the words out, not looking at her.\\n\\n\"But I knew that,\" she said softly.\\n\\n\"You _knew_ it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes! I remember when you told Aunt Betty.\"\\n\\n\"You believed me?\"\\n\\n\"You see,\" she apologised, \"I always wondered why you were masked.\"\\n\\n\"And yet you permitted me to stay--\"\\n\\n\"How silly of you, Mr. Carr! Of course I do not care what you are! I owe\\nso much to you!\"\\n\\nHe wheeled round at that, and faced her.\\n\\n\"Madam, I can bear anything rather than gratitude! Is it only that which\\nhas made you tolerate me all this time?\"\\n\\nHer fingers gripped one another.\\n\\n\"Why, sir--why, sir--\"\\n\\nThe flame died out of his eyes, and he drew himself up stiffly, speaking\\nwith a curtness that surprised her.\\n\\n\"I crave your pardon. I should be whipped at the cart-tail for asking\\nsuch an impertinent question. Forget it, I beg.\"\\n\\nDiana looked up at the stern face, half amazed, half affronted.\\n\\n\"I do not think I quite understand you, sir.\"\\n\\n\"There is nought to understand, mademoiselle,\" he answered with dry\\nlips. \"\\'Twere merely that I was coxcomb enough to hope that you liked me\\na little for mine own sake.\"\\n\\nShe glanced again at his averted head with a wistful little smile.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" she murmured. \"_Oh!_\"--and--\"It is very dreadful to be a\\nhighwayman!\" she sighed.\\n\\n\"Yes, mademoiselle.\"\\n\\n\"But surely you could cease to be one?\" coaxingly.\\n\\nHe did not trust himself to answer.\\n\\n\"I know you could. Please do!\"\\n\\n\"That is not all,\" he forced himself to say. \"There is worse.\"\\n\\n\"_Is_ there?\" she asked wide-eyed. \"What else have you done, Mr. Carr?\"\\n\\n\"I--once--\" heavens, how hard it was to say! \"I once ... cheated ... at\\ncards.\" It was out. Now she would turn from him in disgust. He shut his\\neyes in anticipation of her scorn, his head turned away.\\n\\n\"Only _once_?\" came the soft voice, filled with awed admiration.\\n\\nHis eyes flew open.\\n\\n\"Mademoiselle--!\"\\n\\nShe drooped her head mournfully.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid I always cheat,\" she confessed. \"I had no idea \\'twas so\\nwicked, although Auntie gets very cross and vows she will not play with\\nme.\"\\n\\nHe could not help laughing.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis not wicked in you, child. You do not play for money.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, did you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, child.\"\\n\\n\"Then that _was_ horrid of you,\" she agreed.\\n\\nHe stood silent, fighting the longing to tell her the truth.\\n\\n\"But--but--do not look so solemn, sir,\" the pleading voice went on. \"I\\nam sure you must have had a very strong excuse?\"\\n\\n\"None.\"\\n\\n\"And now you are letting it spoil your life?\" she asked reproachfully.\\n\\n\"It does not wait for my permission,\" he answered bitterly.\\n\\n\"Ah, but what a pity! Must one moment\\'s indiscretion interfere with all\\nelse in life? That is ridiculous. You have--what is the word?--expiated!\\nyes, that is it--expiated it, I know.\"\\n\\n\"The past can never be undone, madam.\"\\n\\n\"That, of course, is true,\" she nodded, with the air of a sage, \"but it\\ncan be forgotten.\"\\n\\nHis hand flew out eagerly and dropped back to his side. It was hopeless.\\nHe could not tell her the truth and ask her to share his disgrace; he\\nmust bear it alone, and, above all, he must not whine. He had chosen to\\ntake Richard\\'s blame and he must abide by the consequences. It was not a\\nburden to be cast off as soon as it became too heavy for him. It was for\\never--for ever. He forced his mind to grasp that fact. All through his\\nlife he must be alone against the world; his name would never be\\ncleared; he could never ask this sweet child who sat before him with\\nsuch a wistful, pleading look on her lovely face, to wed him. He looked\\ndown at her sombrely, telling himself that she did not really care: that\\nit was his own foolish imagination. Now she was speaking: he listened to\\nthe liquid voice that repeated:\\n\\n\"Could it not be forgotten?\"\\n\\n\"No, mademoiselle. It will always be there.\"\\n\\n\"To all intents and purposes, might it not be forgotten?\" she persisted.\\n\\n\"It will always stand in the way, mademoiselle.\"\\n\\nHe supposed that mechanical voice was his own. Through his brain\\nthrummed the thought: \"It is for Dick\\'s sake ... for Dick\\'s sake. For\\nDick\\'s sake you must be silent.\" Resolutely he pulled himself together.\\n\\n\"It will stand in the way--of what?\" asked Diana.\\n\\n\"I can never ask a woman to be my wife,\" he replied.\\n\\nDiana wantonly stripped a rose of its petals, letting each fragrant leaf\\nflutter slowly to the ground.\\n\\n\"I do not see why you cannot, sir.\"\\n\\n\"No woman would share my disgrace.\"\\n\\n\"No?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"You seem very certain, Mr. Carr. Pray have you asked the lady?\"\\n\\n\"No, madam.\" Carstares was as white as she was red, but he was holding\\nhimself well in hand.\\n\\n\"Then--\" the husky voice was very low, \"then--why don\\'t you?\"\\n\\nThe slim hand against the tree trunk was clenched tightly, she observed.\\nIn his pale face the blue eyes burnt dark.\\n\\n\"Because, madam, \\'twere the action of a--of a--\"\\n\\n\"Of a what, Mr. Carr?\"\\n\\n\"A cur! A scoundrel! A blackguard!\"\\n\\nAnother rose was sharing the fate of the first.\\n\\n\"I have heard it said that some women like--curs, and-and--and\\nscoundrels; even blackguards,\" remarked that provocative voice. Through\\nher lashes its owner watched my lord\\'s knuckles gleam white against the\\ntree-bark.\\n\\n\"Not the lady I love, madam.\"\\n\\n\"Oh? But are you sure?\"\\n\\n\"I am sure. She must marry a man whose honour is spotless; who is not--a\\nnameless outcast, and who lives--not--by dice--and highway robbery.\"\\n\\nHe knew that the brown eyes were glowing and sparkling with unshed\\ntears, but he kept his own turned inexorably the other way. There was no\\ndoubting now that she cared, and that she knew that he did also. He\\ncould not leave her to think that her love had been slighted. She must\\nnot be hurt, but made to understand that he could not declare his love.\\nBut how hard it was, with her sorrowful gaze upon him and the pleading\\nnote in her voice. It was quivering now:\\n\\n\"Must she, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, madam.\"\\n\\n\"But supposing--supposing the lady did not care? Supposing she--loved\\nyou--and was willing to share your disgrace?\"\\n\\nThe ground at her feet was strewn with crimson petals, and all around\\nand above her roses nodded and swayed. A tiny breeze was stirring her\\ncurls and the lace of her frock, but John would not allow himself to\\nlook, lest the temptation to catch her in his arms should prove too\\ngreat for him. She was ready to give herself to him; to face anything,\\nonly to be with him. In the plainest language she offered herself to\\nhim, and he had to reject her.\\n\\n\"It is inconceivable that the lady would sacrifice herself in such a\\nfashion, madam,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Sacrifice!\" She caught her breath. \"You call it that!\"\\n\\n\"What else?\"\\n\\n\"I ... I ... I do not think that you are very wise, Mr. Carr. Nor ...\\nthat you ... understand women ... very well. She might not call it by\\nthat name.\"\\n\\n\"It would make no difference what she called it, madam. She would ruin\\nher life, and that must never be.\"\\n\\nA white rose joined its fallen brethren, pulled to pieces by fingers\\nthat trembled pitifully.\\n\\n\"Mr. Carr, if the lady ... loved you ... is it quite fair to her--to say\\nnothing?\"\\n\\nThere was a long silence, and then my lord lied bravely.\\n\\n\"I hope that she will--in time--forget me,\" he said.\\n\\nDiana sat very still. No more roses were destroyed; the breeze wafted\\nthe fallen petals over her feet, lightly, almost playfully. Somewhere in\\nthe hedge a bird was singing, a full-throated sobbing plaint, and from\\nall around came an incessant chirping and twittering. The sun sent its\\nbright rays all over the garden, bathing it in gold and happiness; but\\nfor the two in the pleasaunce the light had gone out, and the world was\\nvery black.\\n\\n\"I see,\" whispered Diana at last. \"Poor lady!\"\\n\\n\"I think it was a cursed day that saw me come into her life,\" he\\ngroaned.\\n\\n\"Perhaps it was,\" her hurt heart made answer.\\n\\nHe bowed his head.\\n\\n\"I can only hope that she will not think too hardly of me,\" he said,\\nvery low. \"And that she will find it in her heart to be sorry--for\\nme--also.\"\\n\\nShe rose and came up to him, her skirts brushing gently over the grass,\\nholding out her hands imploringly.\\n\\n\"Mr. Carr....\"\\n\\nHe would not allow himself to look into the gold-flecked eyes.... He\\nmust remember Dick--his brother Dick!\\n\\nIn his hand he took the tips of her fingers, and bowing, kissed them.\\nThen he turned on his heel and strode swiftly away between the hedges\\ntowards the quiet woods, with a heart aflame with passion, and with\\nrebellion and impotent fury. He would go somewhere quite alone and fight\\nthe devil that was prompting him to cry the truth aloud and to throw\\naside his burden for love, forgetting duty.\\n\\nBut Diana remained standing among the scattered flowers, very still,\\nvery cold, with a look of hopeless longing in her eyes and a great\\nhurt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXV\\n\\nO\\'HARA\\'S MIND IS MADE UP\\n\\n\\nJim Salter folded one of my lord\\'s waistcoats, and placed it carefully\\nin an open valise; then he picked up a coat, and spread it on the bed\\npreparatory to folding it in such wise that no crease should afterwards\\nmar its smoothness. All about him my lord\\'s clothing was strewn; Mechlin\\nruffles and cravats adorned one chair, silk hose another; gorgeous coats\\nhung on their backs; shoes of every description, red-heeled and white,\\nriding boots and slippers, stood in a row awaiting attention; wigs\\nperched coquettishly on handy projections, and piles of white cambric\\nshirts peeped out from an almost finished bag.\\n\\nJim laid the coat tenderly in the valise, coaxing it into decorous\\nfolds, and wondering at the same time where his master was. He had been\\nout all the morning, and on his return had looked so ill that Jim had\\nbeen worried, and wished that they were not leaving Horton House quite\\nso soon. A little while ago my lord had been closeted with his host; Jim\\nsupposed he must still be there. He reached out his hand for another\\nwaistcoat, but before his fingers had touched it, he stopped, and lifted\\nhis head, listening. Hasty, impetuous footsteps sounded on the stairs,\\nand came furiously along the corridor. The door was twisted open, and my\\nlord stood on the threshold. Jim scanned the tired face anxiously, and\\nnoted with a sinking heart that the blue eyes were blazing and the fine\\nlips set in a hard, uncompromising line. The slender hand gripping the\\ndoor-handle twitched in a way that Jim knew full well; evidently my lord\\nwas in an uncertain mood.\\n\\n\"Have you finished?\" rapped out Carstares.\\n\\n\"Not quite, sir.\"\\n\\n\"I wish to leave this year and not next, if \\'tis all the same to you!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir. I didn\\'t know you was in a hurry, sir.\"\\n\\nThere was no reply to this. My lord advanced into the room and cast one\\nglance at his scattered baggage and another all round him.\\n\\n\"Where is my riding dress?\"\\n\\nJim shivered in his luckless shoes.\\n\\n\"I--er--\\'tis packed, sir. Do ye want it?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I want it! Do you suppose that I am going to ride in what I\\nhave on?\"\\n\\n\"I rather thought ye were driving, your honour.\"\\n\\n\"I am not. The scarlet suit at once, please.\"\\n\\nHe flung himself down in a chair before his dressing-table and picked up\\na nail-file.\\n\\nSalter eyed his reflection in the glass dismally, and made no movement\\nto obey. After a moment my lord swung round.\\n\\n\"Well! What are you standing there for? Didn\\'t you hear me?\"\\n\\n\"Ay, sir, I did, but--your pardon, sir--but do ye think \\'tis wise to\\nride to-day for--for the first time?\"\\n\\nThe file slammed down on to the table.\\n\\n\"I am riding to Horley this afternoon!\" said his master dangerously.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a matter of fifteen miles or so, your honour. Hadn\\'t ye better--\"\\n\\n\"Damn you, Jim, be quiet!\"\\n\\nSalter gave it up.\\n\\n\"Very well, sir,\" he said, and unearthed the required dress. \"I\\'ll see\\nthe baggage goes by coach, and saddle the mare and Peter.\"\\n\\n\"Not Peter. You go in the coach.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir.\"\\n\\n\"_What!_\"\\n\\nMy lord stared at him. There had been a note of finality in the\\nrespectful tone. My lord became icy.\\n\\n\"You forget yourself, Salter.\"\\n\\n\"I ask your pardon, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You will travel in charge of my things, as usual.\"\\n\\nJim compressed his lips, and stowed a shoe away in one corner of the\\nbag.\\n\\n\"You understand me?\"\\n\\n\"I understand ye well enough, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Then that is settled.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir.\"\\n\\nMy lord dropped his eye-glass.\\n\\n\"What the devil do you mean--\\'No, sir\\'?\"\\n\\n\"I ask your pardon, sir, an I presume, but I can\\'t and won\\'t let ye ride\\nalone with your wound but just healed.\" There was not a hint of defiance\\nor impertinence in the quiet voice, but it held a great determination.\\n\\n\"You won\\'t, eh? Do you imagine I am a child?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Or unable to take care of myself?\"\\n\\n\"I think ye are weaker than ye know, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you do, do you?\"\\n\\nJim came up to him.\\n\\n\"Ye\\'ll let me ride with ye, sir? I won\\'t trouble ye, and I can ride\\nbehind, but I can\\'t let ye go alone. Ye might faint--sir--\"\\n\\n\"I can assure you I am not like to be a pleasant companion!\" said\\nCarstares with a savage little laugh.\\n\\n\"Why, sir, I understand there\\'s something troubling ye. Will ye let me\\ncome?\"\\n\\nMy lord scowled up at him, then relented suddenly.\\n\\n\"As you please.\"\\n\\n\"Thank ye, sir.\" Salter returned to his packing, cording one bag and\\nplacing it near the door, and quickly filling another. The piles of\\nlinen grew steadily smaller until they disappeared, and he retired into\\na cupboard to reappear with a great armful of coats and small-clothes.\\n\\nFor a long while my lord sat silent staring blankly before him. He\\nwalked to the window and stood with his back to the room, looking out,\\nthen he turned and came back to his chair. Jim, watching him covertly,\\nnoted that the hard glitter had died out of his eyes, and that he looked\\nwearier than ever.\\n\\nCarstares studied his nails for a moment in silence. Presently he spoke:\\n\\n\"Jim.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir?\"\\n\\n\"I shall be--going abroad again shortly.\"\\n\\nIf Carstares had remarked that it was a fine day the man could not have\\nshown less surprise.\\n\\n\"Shall we, sir?\"\\n\\nJohn looked across at him, smiling faintly.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll come, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"I would go anywhere with ye, sir.\"\\n\\n\"And what about that little girl at Fittering?\"\\n\\nSalter blushed and stammered hopelessly.\\n\\n\"My dear fellow, since when have I been blind? Did you think I did not\\nknow?\"\\n\\n\"Why, sir--well, sir--er--yes, sir!\"\\n\\n\"Of course I knew! Can you leave her to come with me?\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t leave ye to stay with her, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure? I do not want you to come against your inclinations.\"\\n\\n\"Women ain\\'t everything, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Are they not? I think they are ... a great deal,\" said my lord\\nwistfully.\\n\\n\"I\\'m mighty fond o\\' Mary, but she knows I must go with you.\"\\n\\n\"Does she? But is it quite fair to her? And I believe I am not minded to\\ndrag you \\'cross Continent again.\"\\n\\n\"Ye won\\'t leave me behind, sir? Ye couldn\\'t do that! Sir-ye\\'re never\\nthinking of going by yourself? I--I--I won\\'t let ye!\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid I cannot spare you. But if you should change your mind,\\ntell me. Is it a promise?\"\\n\\n\"Ay, sir. If I _should_ change my mind.\" Salter\\'s smile was grimly\\nsarcastic.\\n\\n\"I am selfish enough to hope you\\'ll not change. I think no one else\\nwould bear with my vile temper as you do. Help me out of this coat, will\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll never change, sir. And as to tempers--As if I minded!\"\\n\\n\"No. You are marvellous. My breeches. Thanks.\"\\n\\nHe shed his satin small-clothes, and proceeded to enter into white\\nbuckskins. \"Not those boots, Jim, the other pair.\" He leaned against the\\ntable as he spoke, drumming his fingers on a chair-back.\\n\\nA knock fell on the door, at which he frowned and signed to Jim, who\\nwalked across and opened it, slightly.\\n\\n\"Is your master here?\" inquired a well-known voice, and at the sound of\\nit my lord\\'s face lighted up, and Salter stood aside.\\n\\n\"Come in, Miles!\"\\n\\nThe big Irishman complied and cast a swift glance round the disordered\\nroom. He raised his eyebrows at sight of Jack\\'s riding boots and looked\\ninquiringly across at him.\\n\\nMy lord pushed a chair forward with his foot.\\n\\n\"Sit down, man! I thought you were in London?\"\\n\\n\"I was. I brought Molly home yesterday, the darlint, and I heard that ye\\nwere leaving here this afternoon.\"\\n\\n\"Ah?\"\\n\\n\"And as I\\'m not going to let ye slip through me fingers again, I thought\\nI would come and make sure of ye. Ye are a deal too slippery, Jack.\"\\n\\n\"Yet I was coming to see you again whatever happened.\"\\n\\n\"Of course. Ye are coming now--to stay.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no!\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara placed his hat and whip on the table, and stretched his legs with\\na sigh.\\n\\n\"Sure, \\'tis stiff I am! Jim, I\\'ve a chaise outside for the baggage, so\\nye may take it down as soon as may be.\"\\n\\n\"Leave it where it is, Jim. Miles, \\'tis monstrous good of you, but--\"\\n\\n\"Keep your buts to yourself, Jack. Me mind\\'s made up.\"\\n\\n\"And so is mine! I really cannot--\"\\n\\n\"Me good boy, ye are coming to stay with us until ye are recovered, if I\\nhave to knock ye senseless and then carry ye!\"\\n\\nThe lightning smile flashed into Jack\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"How ferocious! But pray do not be ridiculous over a mere scratch.\\nRecovered, indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Ye still look ill. Nay, Jack, take that frown off your face; \\'tis of no\\navail, I am determined.\"\\n\\nThe door closed softly behind Jim as Carstares shook his head.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t, Miles. You must see \\'tis impossible.\"\\n\\n\"Pooh! No one who comes to Thurze House knows ye or anything about ye.\\nYe need not see a soul, but come ye must!\"\\n\\n\"But, Miles--\"\\n\\n\"Jack, don\\'t be a fool! I want ye, and so does Molly. \\'Tis no trap, so\\nye need not look so scared.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not. Indeed, I am very grateful, but--I cannot. I am going abroad\\nalmost at once.\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I mean it.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara sat up.\\n\\n\"So it has come! I knew it would!\"\\n\\n\"What mean you?\"\\n\\n\"Ye\\'ve found out that ye love Mistress Di.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\"\\n\\n\"And she you.\"\\n\\nJack looked at him.\\n\\n\"Oh, ay! I\\'m a tactless oaf, I know, and me manners are atrocious to be\\nfor trying to break through the barriers ye\\'ve put up round yourself.\\nBut, I tell ye, Jack, it hurts to be kept at the end of a pole! I don\\'t\\nwant to force your confidence, but for God\\'s sake don\\'t be treating me\\nas if I were a stranger!\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, Miles. It\\'s confoundedly hard to confide in anyone\\nafter six years\\' solitude.\" He struggled into his coat as he spoke, and\\nsettled his cravat. \"If you want to know the whole truth, \\'tis because\\nof Diana that I am going.\"\\n\\n\"Of course. Ye are in love with her?\"\\n\\n\"It rather points that way, does it not?\"\\n\\n\"Then why the divil don\\'t ye ask her to marry ye?\"\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t I ask her? Because I will not offer her a smirched name!\\nBecause I love her so much that--\" He broke off with a shaky, furious\\nlaugh. \"How can you ask me such a question? I am a desirable _parti,\\nhein? Nom d\\'un nom_! For what do you take me?\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara looked up, calmly studying the wrathful countenance.\\n\\n\"Chivalrous young fool,\" he drawled.\\n\\nAgain the short, angry laugh.\\n\\n\"It is so likely that I should ask her to marry me, is it not?\\n\\'Mademoiselle, you see in me an improvident fool: I began life by\\ncheating at cards, and since then--\\' Oh, I shall believe it myself ere\\nlong! I seem to have told it to so many people. And I lay myself open to\\nthe impertinences of--\" he checked himself, thinking of the interview\\ndownstairs with Mr. Beauleigh.\\n\\n\"Rubbish, Jack.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis not rubbish. I have one recommendation--only one.\"\\n\\n\"Faith, have ye as much? What is it?\"\\n\\nMy lord laughed bitterly.\\n\\n\"I dress rather well.\"\\n\\n\"And fence better, as far as I remember.\"\\n\\n\"I have reason to. That is but another point to damn me. What woman\\nwould marry a fencing-master? Oh, my God! what a mess I have made of my\\nlife.\" He tried to laugh and failed miserably.\\n\\n\"I rather fancy Mistress Di would.\"\\n\\n\"She will not be asked thus to demean herself,\" was the proud answer.\\n\\n\"My dear Jack, ye forget ye are the Earl of Wyncham.\"\\n\\n\"A pretty earl! No thank you, Miles. Richard\\'s son will be Earl--no son\\nof mine.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara brought his fist down on the table with a crash.\\n\\n\"Damn Richard and his son!\"\\n\\nMy lord picked up a jewelled pin and, walking to the glass, proceeded to\\nfasten it in his cravat. The other followed him with smouldering eyes.\\n\\n\"Retired into your shell again?\" he growled.\\n\\nCarstares, with his head slightly on one side, considered the effect of\\nthe pin. Then he came back to his friend.\\n\\n\"My dear Miles, the long and short of it is that I am an unreasonable\\ngrumbler. I made my bed, and I suppose I must-on it.\"\\n\\n\"And will ye be afther telling me who helped ye in the making of it?\"\\n\\nCarstares sat down and started to pull on one boot.\\n\\n\"I foresee we shall be at one another\\'s throats ere long,\" he prophesied\\ncheerfully. \"Did I tell you that I informed Mr. Beauleigh of\\nmy--er--profession to-day?\"\\n\\nMiles forgot his anger in surprise.\\n\\n\"Ye never told him ye were a highwayman?\" he cried.\\n\\n\"Yes, I did. Why not?\"\\n\\n\"Why not? Why wot? God help us all! are ye daft, man? Do ye intend to\\ntell every other person ye meet what ye are? Bedad, \\'tis mad ye are\\nentirely!\"\\n\\nCarstares sighed.\\n\\n\"I was afraid you would not understand.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twould take a wizard to understand ye! Another chivalrous impulse, I\\ndoubt not?\"\\n\\n\"Chiv--! No. It is just that I could not let him think me an honourable\\ngentleman. He took it well, on the whole, and is now frigidly polite.\"\\n\\n\"Polite! I should hope so! The ould scarecrow, after ye\\'d saved his\\ndaughter on him, too! And \\'twas he made ye so furious?\"\\n\\nCarstares laughed.\\n\\n\"He and myself. You see--he--lectured me--oh! quite kindly--on the error\\nof my ways, and--it hurt.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis as well ye are coming to me then, the way things are with ye at\\npresent.\"\\n\\nMy lord opened his mouth to speak, encountered a fiery glance, and shut\\nit again.\\n\\n\"Anything to say?\" inquired O\\'Hara with a threatening gleam in his eye.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied Jack meekly.\\n\\n\"Ye will come?\"\\n\\n\"Please.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara sprang up joyfully.\\n\\n\"Good lad! Lud! but I was afraid at one time--Put on your other boot\\nwhile I go and look for that rascal of yours!\" He hurried out of the\\nroom to find Jim, who, having foreseen the result of the contest, was\\nalready stowing the luggage away on the chaise.\\n\\nHalf-an-hour later, his _adieux_ made, Jim and the baggage following, my\\nlord rode out with O\\'Hara on his way to Thurze House.\\n\\nFor some time there was silence between the two men, with only a\\nperfunctory remark or two on the fineness of the day and the freshness\\nof the mare to break it. Carstares\\' mind was, as his friend well knew,\\ndwelling on all that he had left behind him. His parting with Diana had\\nbeen quite ordinary, she at least making no sign that he was anything\\nbeyond a chance acquaintance; indeed, it had almost seemed to him that\\nher attitude was slightly aloof, as if she had drawn a little into\\nherself. Her hand when he had kissed it had been lifeless and cold, her\\nsmile sweetly remote. He knew that he had held the hand a fraction of a\\nminute longer than was strictly in accordance with the rules of good\\nmanners, and he feared that he had clasped it in most unseemly wise,\\npressing it hard against his lips. He wondered whether she had remarked\\nit. He little guessed that long after he had ridden out of sight, she\\ncontinued to feel that pressure. If he could have seen her passionately\\nkissing each finger separately for fear her lips might pass over the\\nexact spot his had touched, his heart might have been lighter.\\n\\nIt was true that she had retired into her shell, a little hurt at what\\nshe termed his man\\'s blind obstinacy. She had laid her heart bare for\\nhim to read; she had offered herself to him as plainly as if she had\\nspoken in terms less general than in the pleasaunce; she had fought\\ndesperately for her happiness, thrusting aside all thought of maiden\\nmodesty, and when she afterwards had realised what she had done, and\\ntried to imagine what he must think of her, she had blushed dark, and\\nmentally flayed herself for her lack of proper pride and manners.\\nTerrified that he might think her immodest, overwhelmed with sudden\\nshyness, she had been colder in her attitude towards him, than she had\\nintended, even in her anxiety not to appear forward. But in spite of\\nher coldness, how intensely had she hoped that he would sense her love\\nand all that she wanted him to know! Incomprehensible the ways of women!\\n\\nNot endowed with feminine perspicacity or intuition, how could John hope\\nto understand her dual feelings? He only knew that he had hurt her, and\\nthat she had drawn back that she might not lay herself open to more. He\\ncould not hope to understand her when she did not fully understand\\nherself.\\n\\nReflecting on the swiftness with which love had come to them, he\\nbelieved that with a like swiftness it might fade, at least from Diana\\'s\\nmemory. He told himself that he hoped for that end, but he was honest\\nenough to know that it was the last thing in the world he wanted. The\\nmere thought of Diana indifferent to him, or worse, another man\\'s bride,\\nmade him bite on his underlip and tighten his hold on the rein.\\n\\nO\\'Hara cast many a surreptitious glance at the stern young profile\\nbeside him, wondering whether his lordship would last out the tedious\\nride or no. He knew enough of Carstares\\' indomitable courage to believe\\nthat he would, but he feared that it would prove too great a strain on\\nhim in his present weakened condition.\\n\\nVery wisely he made no attempt to draw Carstares out of his abstraction,\\nbut continued to push on in silence, past fields knee-deep in grass,\\nsoon to be hay, with sorrel and poppies growing apace, along lanes with\\nhedges high above their heads on either side, over hill and down\\ndale--always in silence.\\n\\nPresently O\\'Hara fell a little to the rear that he might study his\\nfriend without palpably turning to do so. He thought he had never seen\\nJack\\'s face wear such a black look. The fine brows almost met over his\\nnose with only two sharp furrows to separate them; the mouth was\\ncompressed, the chin a little prominent, and the eyes, staring ahead\\nbetween Jenny\\'s nervous ears, seemed to see all without absorbing\\nanything. One hand at his hip was clenched on his riding-whip, the other\\nmechanically guided the mare.\\n\\nO\\'Hara found himself admiring the lithe grace of the man, with his\\nupright carriage and splendid seat.\\n\\nSuddenly, as if aware that he was being studied, my lord half turned his\\nhead and met O\\'Hara\\'s eyes. He gave a tiny shrug and with it seemed to\\nthrow off his oppression. The frown vanished, and he smiled.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, Miles. I am a surly fellow.\"\\n\\n\"Mayhap your shoulder troubles you,\" suggested O\\'Hara tactfully.\\n\\n\"N-no, I am barely conscious of it. I\\'ve no excuse beyond bad manners\\nand a worse temper.\"\\n\\nFrom thence onward he set himself to entertain his friend, and if his\\nlaugh was sometimes rather forced, at least his wit was enough to keep\\nO\\'Hara in a pleasurable state of amusement for some miles.\\n\\nBy the time they arrived at Thurze House, Carstares was suspiciously\\nwhite about the mouth, and there was once more a furrow--this time of\\npain--between his brows. But he was able to greet my Lady O\\'Hara with\\nfitting elegance and to pay her at least three neat, laughing\\ncompliments before O\\'Hara took him firmly by the arm and marched him to\\nhis room, there to rest and recover before the dinner hour.\\n\\nShortly after, Jim arrived, highly contented with his new surroundings,\\nand able to give a satisfactory verdict on Jenny\\'s stalling. He had\\nquite accepted O\\'Hara as a friend, after some jealous qualms, and was\\nnow well pleased that his master should be in his house instead of\\nroaming the countryside.\\n\\nAt five o\\'clock, as the gong rang, my lord descended the stairs\\nresplendent in old gold and silver trimmings, determined to be as gay\\nand light-hearted as the occasion demanded, as though there had never\\nbeen a Diana to upset the whole course of a man\\'s life.\\n\\nNot for nothing had he fought against the world for six long years.\\nTheir teaching had been to hide all feeling beneath a perpetual mask of\\nnonchalance and wit; never for an instance to betray a hurt, and never\\nto allow it to appear that he was anything but the most care-free of\\nmen. The training stood him in good stead now, and even O\\'Hara wondered\\nto see him in such spirits after all that had passed. Lady Molly was\\ndelighted with her guest, admiring his appearance, his fine, courtly\\nmanners, and falling an easy victim to his charm.\\n\\nO\\'Hara, watching them, saw with content that his capricious little wife\\nwas really attracted to my lord. It was a high honour, for she was hard\\nto please, and many of O\\'Hara\\'s acquaintances had been received, if not\\nwith actual coldness, at least not with any degree of warmth.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal she withdrew with the warning that they were not\\nto sit too long over their wine, and that Miles was not to fatigue his\\nlordship.\\n\\nO\\'Hara pushed the decanter towards his friend.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve a piece of news I daresay will interest ye!\" he remarked.\\n\\nCarstares looked at him inquiringly.\\n\\n\"Ay. \\'Tis that his Grace of Andover has withdrawn his precious person to\\nParis.\"\\n\\nCarstares raised one eyebrow.\\n\\n\"I suppose he would naturally wish to remain in the background after our\\nlittle fracas.\"\\n\\n\"Does he ever wish to be in the background?\"\\n\\n\"You probably know him better than I do. Does he?\"\\n\\n\"He does not. \\'Tis always in front he is, mighty prominent. Damn him!\"\\n\\nMy lord was faintly surprised.\\n\\n\"Why that? Has he ever interfered with you?\"\\n\\n\"He has interfered with me best friend to some purpose.\"\\n\\n\"I fear the boot was on the other leg!\"\\n\\n\"Well, I know something of how he interferes with Dick.\"\\n\\nCarstares put down his glass, all attention now.\\n\\n\"With Dick? How?\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara seemed to regret having spoken\\n\\n\"Oh, well--I\\'ve no sympathy with _him_.\"\\n\\n\"What has Tracy done to him?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis nothing of great moment. Merely that he and that worthless brother\\nof his seek to squeeze him dry.\"\\n\\n\"Robert?\"\\n\\n\"Andrew. I know very little of Robert.\"\\n\\n\"Andrew! But he was a child--\"\\n\\n\"Well, he\\'s grown up now, and as rakish a young spendthrift as ye could\\nwish for. Dick seems to pay their debts.\"\\n\\n\"Devil take him! Why?\"\\n\\n\"Heaven knows! I suppose Lavinia insists. We all knew that \\'twas for\\nthat reason Tracy flung you both in her way.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense! We went of our own accord. She had but returned from school.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. And whose doing was that but Tracy\\'s?\"\\n\\nCarstares opened his eyes rather wide and leant both arms on the table,\\ncrooking his fingers round the stem of his wine glass.\\n\\n\"Do the debts amount to much?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t tell ye that. \\'Twas but by chance I found it out at all. The\\nBelmanoirs were never moderate in their manner of living.\"\\n\\n\"Nor were any of us. Don\\'t be so hard on them, Miles!... I knew, of\\ncourse, that the Belmanoir estate was mortgaged, but I did not guess to\\nwhat extent.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that either, but Dick\\'s money does not go to pay it off.\\n\\'Tis all frittered away on gambling and pretty women.\"\\n\\nMy lord\\'s brow darkened ominously.\\n\\n\"Ye-s. I think I shall have a little score to settle with Tracy on that\\nsubject--some day.\"\\n\\nMiles said nothing.\\n\\n\"But how does Dick manage without touching my money?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know.\" O\\'Hara\\'s tone implied that he cared less.\\n\\n\"I hope he is not in debt himself,\" mused Carstares, \"\\'Tis like enough\\nhe is in some muddle. I wish I might persuade him to accept the\\nrevenue.\" He frowned and drummed his fingers on the table.\\n\\nO\\'Hara exploded.\\n\\n\"Sure, \\'twould be like you to be doing the same. Let the man alone for\\nthe Lord\\'s sake, and don\\'t be after worrying your head over a miserable\\nspalpeen that did ye more harm than--\"\\n\\n\"Miles, I cannot allow you to speak so of Dick! You do not understand.\"\\n\\n\"I understand well enough. \\'Tis too Christian ye are entirely. And let\\nus have an end of this farce of yours! I know that Dick cheated as well\\nas you do, and I say \\'tis unnatural for you to be wanting him to take\\nyour money after he\\'s done you out of honour and all else!\"\\n\\nCarstares sipped his wine quietly, waiting for Miles\\' anger to\\nevaporate, as it presently did, leaving him to glower balefully. Then he\\nstarted to laugh.\\n\\n\"Oh, Miles, let me go my own road! I\\'m a sore trial to you, I know.\"\\nThen suddenly sobering: \"But I want you not to think so hardly of Dick.\\nYou know enough of him to understand a little how it all came about. You\\nknow how extravagant he was and how often in debt--can you not pardon\\nthe impulse of a mad moment?\"\\n\\n\"That I could pardon. What I cannot forgive is his--unutterable meanness\\nin letting you bear the blame.\"\\n\\n\"O\\'Hara, he was in love with Lavinia--\"\\n\\n\"So were you.\"\\n\\n\"Not so deeply. With me \\'twas a boy\\'s passion, but with him \\'twas\\nserious.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara remained silent, his mouth unusually hard.\\n\\n\"Put yourself in his place,\" pleaded Jack. \"If you--\"\\n\\n\"Thank you!\" O\\'Hara laughed unpleasantly. \"No, Jack, we shall not agree\\non this subject, and we had best leave it alone. I do not think you need\\nworry about him, though. I believe he is not in debt.\"\\n\\n\"Does he have fair luck with his racing and his--\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara smiled grimly.\\n\\n\"Dick is a very changed man, John. He does not keep racehorses, neither\\ndoes he play cards, save for appearance\\'s sake.\"\\n\\n\"Dick not play! What then does he do?\"\\n\\n\"Manages your estates and conducts his wife to routs. When in town,\"\\nbitterly, \"he inhabits your house.\"\\n\\n\"Well, there is none else to use it. But I cannot imagine Dick turned\\nsober!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis easy to be righteous after the evil is done, I\\'m thinking!\"\\n\\nMy lord ignored this remark. A curious smile played about his mouth.\\n\\n\"Egad, Miles, \\'tis very entertaining! I, the erstwhile sober\\nmember--what is the matter?--am now the profligate: I dice, I gamble, I\\nrob. Dick the ne\\'er-do-weel is a saint. He--er--lives a godly and\\nrighteous life, and--er--is robbed by his wife\\'s relations. After all, I\\ndo not think I envy him overmuch.\"\\n\\n\"At least, you enjoy life more than he does,\" said O\\'Hara, grinning.\\n\"For ye have no conscience to reckon with.\"\\n\\nCarstares\\' face was inscrutable. He touched his lips with his napkin and\\nsmiled.\\n\\n\"As you say, I enjoy life the more--but as to conscience, I do not think\\nit is that.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara glanced at him sitting sideways in his chair, one arm flung over\\nits back.\\n\\n\"Will ye be offended if I ask ye a question?\"\\n\\n\"Of course not.\"\\n\\n\"Then--do ye intend to go back to this highroad robbery?\"\\n\\n\"I do not.\"\\n\\n\"What then will you do?\"\\n\\nThe shadows vanished, and my lord laughed.\\n\\n\"To tell you the truth, Miles, I\\'ve not yet settled that point. Fate\\nwill decide--not I.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVI\\n\\nMR. BETTISON PROPOSES\\n\\n\\nMr. Bettison could make nothing of Diana of late. Her demeanour, at\\nfirst so charming and so cheerful, had become listless, and even\\nchilling. She seemed hardly to listen to some of his best tales, and\\ntwice she actually forgot to laugh at what was surely a most witty\\npleasantry. It struck him that she regarded him with a resentful eye, as\\nif she objected to his presence at Horton House, and had no desire to be\\ncourted. But Mr. Bettison was far too egotistic to believe such a thing,\\nand he brushed the incredible suspicion away, deciding that her coldness\\nwas due to a very proper shyness. He continued his visits until they\\nbecame so frequent that scarce a day passed without his strutting step\\nbeing heard approaching the house and his voice inquiring for the Miss\\nBeauleighs. Mr. Beauleigh, who secretly hoped for Mr. Bettison as a\\nson-in-law, would not permit the ladies to deny themselves, and he\\nfurther counselled Miss Betty to absent herself after the first few\\nmoments, leaving the young couple together. Thus it was that it so\\ncontinually fell to Diana\\'s lot to receive the Squire and to listen to\\nhis never-ending monologues. She persistently snubbed him, hoping to\\nward off the impending proposal, but either her snubs were not severe\\nenough, or Mr. Bettison\\'s skin was too thick to feel them; for not a\\nfortnight after my lord\\'s departure, he begged her hand in marriage. It\\nwas refused him with great firmness, but, taking the refusal for\\ncoquettishness, he pressed his suit still more amorously, and with such\\na self-assured air that Mistress Di became indignant.\\n\\n\"Sir,\" she cried, \"it seems you have indeed misread my attitude towards\\nyou!\"\\n\\nMr. Bettison was struck dumb with amazement. It had never entered his\\nbrain that Diana could seriously refuse him. He could hardly believe his\\nears at this quite unmistakable tone of voice, and sat gaping.\\n\\n\"I must beg,\" continued Diana, \"I must beg that you will discontinue\\nyour all-too-frequent visits here. Please do not deem me unkind, but\\nyour persecution of me--I can call it nothing else--is\\nwearying--and--you will forgive the word--tiresome. I confess I am\\nsurprised that you had not perceived your attentions to be distasteful\\nto me.\"\\n\\n\"Distasteful!\" cried Mr. Bettison, recovering after two or three\\nunsuccessful attempts from his speechlessness. \"Do you mean what you\\nsay, Miss Diana? That you will not wed me?\"\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr. Bettison, I do.\"\\n\\n\"And that my attentions are displeasing to you! Well, Miss Beauleigh!\\nWell, indeed!\"\\n\\nDiana softened a little.\\n\\n\"I am indeed sorry that you should have misconstrued--\"\\n\\n\"No misconstruction, madam!\" snapped the Squire, who was fast losing\\ncontrol over his temper. \"Do you dare aver that you did not encourage me\\nto visit you?\"\\n\\n\"I do, most emphatically!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see what \\'tis! You cannot hoodwink me. \\'Twas never thus with you\\nbefore that fellow came!\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bettison, I am entirely at a loss, but I desire you to leave this\\nroom before you say aught you may afterwards regret.\"\\n\\nHe disregarded her.\\n\\n\"You are infatuated by that over-dressed popinjay--that insufferable\\nCarr, who, from all I hear, is but a shady fellow, and who--\"\\n\\nWith a sweeping movement Diana had risen and walked to the bell-rope.\\nShe now pulled it with such vigour that a great peal sounded throughout\\nthe house.\\n\\nShe stood perfectly still, a statue of Disdain, tall, beautiful and\\nfurious, with compressed lips and head held high. Mr. Bettison broke off\\nand mopped his brow, glaring at her.\\n\\nStartled Thomas appeared at the door.\\n\\n\"Did you ring, madam?\"\\n\\n\"Show Mr. Bettison out,\" was the proud answer.\\n\\nThe Squire got up awkwardly.\\n\\n\"I am sure I apologise if I said aught that was untrue,\" he mumbled. \"I\\nhope you will not take my words amiss--\"\\n\\n\"I shall try to forget your insults, sir,\" she replied. \"The door,\\nThomas!\"\\n\\nMr. Bettison went out, and his step had lost some of its self-confident\\nswagger.\\n\\nFor a full minute after the great front door had shut behind him, Diana\\nstood where she was, and then the colour suddenly flamed in her cheeks,\\nand she turned and ran out of the room, up the stairs, to her own\\nchamber, where she indulged in a luxurious fit of crying. From this\\nenjoyable occupation she was interrupted by a rap on the door, and Miss\\nBetty\\'s voice desiring to know if she was within.\\n\\nShe instantly started up and with hasty fingers straightened her tumbled\\ncurls.\\n\\n\"Pray enter!\" she called, trying to sound jaunty. To complete the\\nillusion, she started to hum. Her aunt entered.\\n\\n\"I came to see if you had my broidery. I cannot find it, and I am sure\\n\\'twas you brought it in from the garden this morning.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--oh, yes--I am so sorry! \\'Tis in that corner on the chair, I\\nthink,\" replied Diana, keeping her face averted.\\n\\nMiss Betty cast a shrewd glance at her, and sat down on the sofa with\\nthe air of one who means to stay.\\n\\n\"What is it, my love?\" she demanded.\\n\\nDiana pretended to search for something in a cupboard.\\n\\n\"Nothing, aunt! What should there be?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. \\'Tis what I want to find out,\" answered Miss Betty\\nplacidly.\\n\\n\"There is nought amiss, I assure you!\" To prove the truth of this\\nstatement, Diana essayed a laugh. It was a poor attempt, and wavered\\npitifully into a sob.\\n\\n\"My pet, don\\'t tell me! You are crying!\"\\n\\n\"I--I\\'m n-not!\" avowed Diana, hunting wildly for her\\npocket-handkerchief. \"\\'Tis a cold in the head I have had these three\\ndays.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, my love? Longer than that, I fear.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--perhaps so--I--What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I doubt but what you caught it the day that Mr. Carr left us.\"\\n\\nDiana started.\\n\\n\"P-pray, do not be ridiculous, auntie!\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear. Come and sit beside me and tell me all about it,\" coaxed\\nMiss Betty.\\n\\nDiana hesitated, gave a damp sniff, and obeyed.\\n\\nMiss Betty drew her head down on to her shoulder soothingly.\\n\\n\"There, there! Don\\'t cry, my sweet! What has happened?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis that odious Mr. Bettison!\" sobbed Diana \"He--he had the audacity\\nto ask me to m-marry him!\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t say so, my love! I thought I heard him arrive. So you sent\\nhim about his business?\"\\n\\n\"N-not before he had time to insult m-me!\"\\n\\n\"Insult you? Di!\"\\n\\n\"He--he dared to insinuate--oh no! he accused me outright--of being\\ninfatuated by Mr. Carr! Infatuated!\"\\n\\nOver her head Miss Betty opened her eyes at her own reflection in the\\nglass.\\n\\n\"The brute! But, of course, \\'tis true?\"\\n\\nNo answer.\\n\\n\"Is it not?\"\\n\\nThe sobs came faster.\\n\\n\"Of--of course \\'tis true, but h-how dared he say so?\"\\n\\n\"Di, my love, you really are in love with that boy?\"\\n\\n\"I--I--I asked him to marry me--and he wouldn\\'t!\"\\n\\n\"Good gracious heavens!\" Miss Betty was genuinely horrified. \"My dear\\nDiana!\"\\n\\n\"N-not outright--b-but he understood--and--he loves me! And I\\'d do it\\nagain to-morrow, if I could--immodest or no! So there!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" soothed Miss Betty hastily. \"Tell me all about it.\" Diana\\nlifted her head.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all. And he loves me--he does--he does!\"\\n\\n\"Did he say so?\"\\n\\n\"N-no--but I could tell. And I love him\"--sob--\"and I\\'d sooner die than\\nlive without him, and he won\\'t ask me b-because he has not got a\\nspotless p-past, and he\\'d be a cur, and horrid things, and my husband\\nmust not be an--an--outcast, and-and--and I don\\'t care!\"\\n\\nHer bewildered aunt unravelled this with difficulty.\\n\\n\"He\\'d be a cur if he asked you to marry him?\" she asked, with knitted\\nbrows.\\n\\n\"Yes. Because he\\'s a highwayman.\"\\n\\n\"A highwayman! Then \\'twas true what he said? Well, well! I should never\\nhave thought it! That nice boy!\"\\n\\nDiana disengaged herself; in her eyes was a threatening gleam.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t dare say a word against him!\"\\n\\n\"No, no--of course not! I was only surprised. But I am thankfully glad\\nhe did not ask you, for all that!\"\\n\\n\"Glad? How can you be so cruel?\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you could not possibly marry--a--a--\"\\n\\n\"Common felon!\" sobbed Diana. \"I can--I can!\"\\n\\n\"And heaven alone knows what else he may have done! Why, child, he said\\nhimself that he had a--a spotty past!\"\\n\\nAt this her niece gave a tearful giggle.\\n\\n\"La! What ails you now, Di?\"\\n\\n\"H-he never said--spotty.\"\\n\\nMiss Betty smiled reluctantly.\\n\\n\"A doubtful past, then.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe it!\"\\n\\nHer aunt pursed up her lips.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t believe it. He couldn\\'t be wicked. You forget he saved me!\"\\n\\nMiss Betty relented.\\n\\n\"No, I do not, my love; and, to be sure, I think he is a dear boy, but I\\nalso think \\'twas very right of him to go away.\"\\n\\nShe was enveloped in a rapturous embrace.\\n\\n\"Auntie, you know you love him almost as much as I do?\"\\n\\n\"No, that I do not!\" was the grim retort. \"_I_ am not like to want to\\nmarry him!\"\\n\\nThere was another watery giggle at this, and Diana went over to the\\ndressing-table to tidy her hair.\\n\\n\"I doubt I shall never see him again,\" she said wretchedly. \"Oh, auntie,\\nif you could but have seen his dear, unhappy eyes!\"\\n\\n\"Stuff and nonsense! Not see him again, forsooth! He will call upon us\\nin town. \\'Tis but common politeness.\"\\n\\n\"You forget he is a highwayman, and not like to come nigh us again.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my dear, if he cares for you as you say he does, he will see to\\nit that he takes up some decent occupation. Mayhap, he will go into the\\narmy, or what not. Then wait and see if he does not come to you.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?\" doubtfully.\\n\\n\"Of course I do, sweetheart! And if he does not try to mend his ways,\\nand you see him no more--why then, snap your fingers at him, my love,\\nfor he will not be worth one tear!\"\\n\\nDiana sighed and poured out some water to bathe her face with.\\n\\n\"Is not that sensible?\" coaxed her aunt.\\n\\nShe raised her head and looked unutterable scorn.\\n\\n\"I think \\'tis remarkable silly,\" she answered. Then her dignity fell\\nfrom her. \"Oh, are all men such big stupids?\" she cried.\\n\\n\"Most of \\'em,\" nodded her aunt.\\n\\n\"But can\\'t he tell that I shall be--oh, so miserable, and that I should\\nnot ruin my life if I married him?\"\\n\\n\"My dear, once a man gets an idea into his head, \\'tis the very devil to\\nget it out of him! Not but what I think Master Jack is right, mind you.\\nAnd your dear papa and I had looked higher for you. After all--what is\\nMr. Carr?\"\\n\\n\"He is the only man I will ever marry! So you may cease looking higher\\nfor me! I suppose you want me to marry that great gaby, Sir Denis\\nFabian, you are for ever inviting to the house? Or, perhaps, this\\ngallant Mr. Bettison? Or Mr. Everard? How _can_ you be so unkind?\"\\n\\n\"I am not. But I could not bear to see you throw yourself away on a\\nhighwayman, my dear.\"\\n\\nDiana ran to her, putting her arms round her neck.\\n\\n\"Dearest auntie, forgive my rudeness! I know you did not mean to be\\nunkind! But you do not understand--I _love_ him.\"\\n\\n\"I always said you\\'d take it badly,\" nodded Miss Betty gloomily.\\n\\n\"Take what badly?\"\\n\\n\"Love. And no man is worth one tear-drop, sweet.\"\\n\\nThe confident, tender little laugh that answered this statement made her\\nlook at her suddenly changed niece in surprise.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know,\" said Diana. Her eyes were soft and luminous. \"You just\\ndo not know.\"\\n\\nBefore Miss Betty could think of a suitable retort, a knock fell on the\\ndoor. It was opened, and Thomas was found to be without.\\n\\n\"My Lady O\\'Hara is below, madam.\"\\n\\nFor an instant the two ladies stared at one another. Then:\\n\\n\"La and drat!\" said Miss Betty. \"With the drawing-room in a muddle after\\ncleaning!\"\\n\\nDiana nodded to the man.\\n\\n\"We will come, Thomas.\" Then as soon as he had withdrawn, she stared\\nagain at her aunt. \"Lady O\\'Hara! But why?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose she felt she must call after Sir Miles had been here so\\noften. But why, for goodness\\' sake, must she choose the one day that the\\ndrawing-room is all untidy? Drat again, I say!\"\\n\\nDiana was powdering her little nose, and anxiously looking to see if the\\ntear-stains had quite vanished.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis not untidy, Aunt Betty. Oh, I am quite eager to see her--I think\\nshe must be charming, from all Sir Miles said. Do hurry, aunt!\"\\n\\nMiss Betty stuck a pin into her hair and smoothed out her dress.\\n\\n\"And me in this old taffeta!\" she grumbled.\\n\\nDiana swirled round, her own peach-coloured silk rustling fashionably.\\n\\n\"Never mind, dear--you look very sweet. But _do_ be quick!\" Miss Betty\\nsuffered herself to be led to the door.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis all very fine for you, my love, with a new gown fresh on to-day!\\nWill you just take a look at my petticoat, though?\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense, you are beautiful! Come!\"\\n\\nTogether they descended the stairs, and went into the drawing-room.\\n\\nA dainty, very diminutive little lady arose from a chair at their entry,\\nand came forward with outstretched hands, and such a fascinating smile\\nthat Miss Betty\\'s ill-humour vanished, and she responded to her\\nvisitor\\'s deep curtsy with one of her best jerky dips.\\n\\n\"I am vastly delighted to welcome you, madam,\" she said primly. \"\\'Tis\\ngood in you to come this long way to see us.\"\\n\\nShe drew a chair forward for my lady, and presented her niece. Lady\\nO\\'Hara gave the girl a swift, scrutinising glance, and curtsied again.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a great pleasure to me to meet you at last, Miss Beauleigh,\" she\\nsmiled. \"My husband has told me so much of you, I declare I was all agog\\nto meet you!\"\\n\\nDiana warmed instantly to the little lady\\'s charm.\\n\\n\"Indeed, madam, we, too, have heard much of you from Sir Miles. _We_\\nhave wanted to meet _you_!\"\\n\\nLady O\\'Hara seated herself and nodded briskly.\\n\\n\"I expect he told you some dreadful tales of me,\" she said happily. \"I\\nmust ask your pardon for not having visited you before, but, as I\\ndaresay you know, I have been away, and, gracious me, when I returned\\neverything seemed topsy-turvy!\" She laughed across at Miss Betty. \"I\\npromise you I have had my hands full putting things to rights, Miss\\nBeauleigh!\"\\n\\nMiss Betty drew her chair closer, and in a minute they were deep in\\ntruly feminine conversation: the prodigious extravagance of the\\nservants; the helplessness of men-folk when left to themselves, and then\\nLondon, its shops, its parks, the newest play.\\n\\nLady O\\'Hara was begged to take a dish of Miss Betty\\'s precious Bohea--a\\nvery high honour indeed--and when Mr. Beauleigh came into the room he\\nfound his sister and daughter seated on either side of a pretty,\\nanimated little lady whom he had never before seen, talking hard, and\\npartaking of tay and angel cakes. Whereupon he retired hastily and shut\\nhimself up in his library.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVII\\n\\nLADY O\\'HARA WINS HER POINT\\n\\n\\nLady O\\'Hara looked across at her sleeping husband with no little\\nseverity in her glance. He was stretched in a chair beneath a giant oak,\\nand she was busied with some needlework a few paces from him. O\\'Hara\\'s\\neyes were shut and his mouth open. My lady frowned and coughed. She\\nrasped her throat quite considerably, but it was not without effect; her\\nspouse shut his mouth and opened one lazy eyelid. Immediately my lady\\nassumed an air of gentle mournfulness, and the eye regarding her\\ntwinkled a little, threatening to close. Molly looked reproachful, and\\nbegan to speak in an aggrieved tone:\\n\\n\"Indeed, and I do not think it at all kind in you to go to sleep when I\\nwant to talk, sir.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara hastily opened the other eye.\\n\\n\"Why, my love, I was not asleep! I was--er--thinking!\"\\n\\n\"Do you say so, sir? And do you usually think with your mouth\\nopen--_snoring_?\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara started up.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll swear I did not snore!\" he cried. \"Molly, \\'tis a wicked tease ye\\nare!\"\\n\\n\"Miles, \\'tis a big baby you are!\" she mimicked. \"There is a caterpillar\\non your wig, and \\'tis on crooked.\"\\n\\n\"The caterpillar?\" asked O\\'Hara, bewildered.\\n\\n\"No, stupid, the wig. I had best straighten it for you, I suppose.\" She\\nrose and stooped over him, settling the wig and removing the caterpillar\\nby means of two leaves, judiciously wielded. Then she dropped a kiss on\\nher husband\\'s brow and sat down at his feet.\\n\\n\"First, you have never asked me where I was gone to all yesterday\\nafternoon.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara had been carefully broken in, and he now knew what was expected\\nof him, and put on an expression of great interest.\\n\\n\"Where _did_ ye go, my lady?\"\\n\\n\"I went to call on Miss Beauleigh and her niece, sir!\"\\n\\nShe looked up at him triumphantly and a little challengingly.\\n\\n\"The devil ye did!\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, sir. I knew that there was something in the air, and I\\nremembered your letter to me saying that Jack was in love with Diana. So\\nI thought I would go and see her for myself.\"\\n\\nMiles looked down at her half indulgently, half vexedly.\\n\\n\"Did you, puss?\"\\n\\n\"I did. And I found that she was in love with him as well as he with\\nher--of course.\"\\n\\n\"Of course?\"\\n\\n\"Who could help falling in love with him? He\\'s so monstrous captivating,\\nI would like to marry him myself.\"\\n\\nShe bent her head to hide the roguish smile that had sprung to her lips.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon?\" asked O\\'Hara, startled.\\n\\nMy lady traced patterns on his knee.\\n\\n\"Provided, of course, that I had not already married you, Miles.\"\\n\\nBut O\\'Hara had seen the smile. He heaved a great sigh, and said in\\nlugubrious tones:\\n\\n\"There is always the river, madam.\"\\n\\nMy lady\\'s finger wavered and stopped, and her hand tucked itself away\\ninto his.\\n\\n\"That is not a nice joke, Miles.\"\\n\\nHe laughed, and tweaked one of her curls.\\n\\n\"Sure, and did ye not ask for it, asthore?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I did not. But about Jack, dear--\"\\n\\n\"I thought it _was_ about Jack?\"\\n\\n\"Miles, will you be quiet and attend?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, m\\'dear.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, then. As I have told you, I drove over to Littledean\\nyesterday afternoon, and made the acquaintance of the Miss Beauleighs.\"\\n\\n\"And what did ye think of them?\"\\n\\n\"I thought Diana was wonderfully beautiful--such eyes, Miles!--and such\\nhair! Miss Beauleigh is very amiable, and so droll! I drank a dish of\\ntay with them, and I spoke of Jack--\"\\n\\n\"Madcap, never tell me ye called him Carstares?\"\\n\\n\"No, you great gaby! Of course I did not. As it chanced, Miss Beauleigh\\nmentioned him first, and she called him Mr. Carr. So I did, too. And I\\nnoticed that Diana said scarce a word about him, and when she did \\'twas\\nof the coolest. That, of course, made me all the more certain that she\\nloved him.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara was plainly puzzled.\\n\\n\"But why should you be certain if she did not speak of him, alanna?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis what you\\'ll never understand, my dear, because you are but a man.\\nBut no matter--I knew. I quite adored Diana, and determined to talk to\\nher alone. So I admired the roses, and she offered to escort me round\\nthe garden, which was what I wanted. We went out together. I think Diana\\nmust have liked me, for--\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\"\\n\\n\"Be quiet, Miles!--for she dropped her ice and became quite friendly.\\nAnd I talked a lot.\"\\n\\nShe was aware of a convulsive movement above her, and a suppressed\\ncough. She raised inquiring eyebrows.\\n\\n\"Well, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, asthore--nothing. Go on with the tale--you were saying--\"\\n\\n\"That I talked a lot.\" She paused, and her eyes dared him; then she\\ndimpled and dropped her lashes over them. \"I shan\\'t tell you all I\\nsaid--\"\\n\\nA relieved sigh interrupted her.\\n\\n\"And if you continue to behave in this disagreeable fashion I shall not\\nsay another word about anything!\"\\n\\nHaving satisfied herself that he was not going to venture a retort, she\\ncontinued:\\n\\n\"We had a long chat, and I gathered, from all she said and left unsaid,\\nthat Jack, for some foolish reason, will not ask her to marry him.\"\\n\\n\"Foolish reason, asthore?\" he interrupted.\\n\\n\"Oh, I know you consider it a remarkable fine reason, but I tell you,\\n\\'tis rank cruelty to that poor child. As if she cared about highwaymen!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twas not so much that, I take it, as--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but he could tell her he was innocent--oh, Miles, do not look so\\nprovoking! Of course he could! I vow if you had treated me so, I would\\nnever have let you go until you had truly repented! I am of a mind to\\nspeak to Jack.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twould be an entertaining sight, but ye\\'ll kindly have a care how you\\ntouch him, my lady.\"\\n\\n\"He does not understand. I _know_ she would be proud to marry him--\"\\n\\n\"And ye\\'d think it a fine thing in Jack to ask her, the way things are\\nwith him at present?\"\\n\\n\"I--oh, I don\\'t know!\"\\n\\n\"No, me love. Jack is right: he must first clear his name.\"\\n\\n\"Then, gracious goodness me, why does he not?\" cried Molly, exasperated.\\n\\nThis time it was O\\'Hara\\'s turn to look superior.\\n\\n\"Well, alanna, that\\'s a question ye cannot hope to understand--because\\nye are but a woman.\"\\n\\nLady O\\'Hara ignored the challenge.\\n\\n\"But what is to be done?\"\\n\\n\"Nought. He will have to work it out himself. He bound me to secrecy\\nsome time ago, or I would be tempted to speak to Richard.\"\\n\\n\"I quite _hate_ Richard!\" she cried. \"He must be a selfish, unkind\\nperson. And now Jack swears he must go away almost at once--and, oh! you\\nshould have seen Diana\\'s face of despair when I mentioned that he was\\ngoing abroad again. Miles, we must keep him here as long as ever we can!\\nOh, dear! \\'tis all very worrying.\"\\n\\nShe broke off as O\\'Hara pressed her hand warningly. My lord was coming\\nacross the lawn towards them.\\n\\n\"I am in dire disgrace,\" he said. \"I was left with your ferocious baby,\\nMolly, and to quiet him, I gave him a string of beads that you had left\\non the table.\"\\n\\n\"My precious Indian wooden beads!\"\\n\\n\"Yes--I believe so. Anyway, the paint came off, and when Jane returned,\\nDavid looked as though he had some horrible disease. She was most\\nannoyed about it.\" He sat down in Molly\\'s lately vacated chair, and\\ncarefully wiped a daub of green from his forefinger.\\n\\nMolly laughed.\\n\\n\"Poor Jane! She will have such a task to clean him. But you\\'ve arrived\\nmost opportunely. We were talking of you.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara groaned inwardly, and tried to frown her down.\\n\\n\"You were? I am flattered! May I ask what you were saying?\"\\n\\n\"Why, that we do not want you to go back to France.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara breathed again.\\n\\n\"That is very kind of you, my lady. I regret the necessity myself.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure it is necessary? You might just as well live in a nice\\nplace near here, with a dear old woman to keep house for you--and--and\\nJim--and--lots of pleasant things.\"\\n\\nMy lord shook his head.\\n\\n\"No, thank you!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes! And later on you could choose a wife!\" she continued\\naudaciously.\\n\\n\"Not at all. There would be no choice; I should be made to marry the\\ndear old woman. You would bully me into it.\"\\n\\nShe laughed.\\n\\n\"Seriously, Jack, could you not settle down near here?\"\\n\\n\"Not with that old woman, Molly.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind her; won\\'t you consider it? No one need know you--in fact,\\nyou need see no one--and--oh, Jack! don\\'t look like that. Miles, is he\\nnot ridiculous?\"\\n\\n\"Sure, alanna, \\'tis a dreary life he\\'d be leading,\" chuckled O\\'Hara.\\n\\n\"I see what it is, Molly. You have planned to make me a recluse, _and_\\nto marry me to my housekeeper. I protest, \\'tis great ill-usage!\"\\n\\nMolly eyed him doubtfully.\\n\\n\"Would you _much_ object to the life, John?\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" he replied solemnly, \"you would find my corpse in the garden at\\nthe end of the first week.\"\\n\\n\"Of course I should not like that,\" she pondered. \"But I do not see what\\nelse we can do for you. Oh, and that reminds me! I drove over to\\nLittledean yesterday--Miles, my love, will you be so kind as to fetch me\\nmy hat? I protest, the sun--\"\\n\\n\"We will move more into the shade,\" said her disobliging husband.\\n\\n\"Oh, well! \\'tis of no account, though I did hear that Brown was wanting\\nto speak to you about the new cob--\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis prodigious thoughtful of you, Molly, but I met Brown some time\\nago.\"\\n\\nLady O\\'Hara gave it up.\\n\\n\"Well, as I was saying, Jack, I went to call at Horton House. Dear me,\\nwhat a beautiful girl Diana is, to be sure!\"\\n\\nCarstares tried to think of something to say, and failing, made a\\nnon-committal sound.\\n\\n\"Yes. They both sent their kind wishes, and hoped you were better.\\nGoodness! \\'tis very close here. I wonder if you will give me your arm\\nround the garden? And would _you_ fetch me my hat? I left it in the\\nhall, I think. Thank you very much!\"\\n\\nShe waited until he was out of earshot before she turned to her husband.\\n\\n\"Now, Miles, you must please to stay where you are. I am not going to do\\nanything indiscreet.\"\\n\\n\"Molly, I can\\'t have ye worry him--\"\\n\\n\"No such thing! I am going to coax him to stay here instead of going\\nabroad. I feel sure that if we can but persuade him to stay, something\\nwill happen.\"\\n\\n\"What will happen?\"\\n\\n\"Something!\"\\n\\n\"How do ye know?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know; I only feel it.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, asthore. If you can tease Jack into staying, I\\'ll bless ye.\"\\n\\n\"That will be most enjoyable, I make no doubt!\" she answered, and\\nstepped back out of reach.\\n\\n\"Oh, thank you, John!\" She tied the hat over her curls, and placed her\\nhand on my lord\\'s arm. \"Lazy Miles is going to sleep again!\" she said.\\n\"And I so dislike to hear him snore, so let\\'s go a long way away--into\\nthe rose garden!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t go so far as all that!\" drawled Miles, closing his eyes. \"You\\nwill tire yourselves.\"\\n\\n\"Do you allow him to make these ribald remarks?\" inquired Jack, waiting\\nfor her to extricate a stone from her shoe.\\n\\n\"Not usually,\" she answered. \"He takes advantage when you are here.\" She\\ndropped the pebble on top of O\\'Hara and strolled away with my lord.\\n\\nAs soon as they had rounded a corner in the shrubbery, she commenced the\\nattack.\\n\\n\"I want to speak to you of Miles,\" she confided. \"He is so worried.\"\\n\\n\"Is he, Molly? Faith, I hadn\\'t noticed it!\"\\n\\nShe reflected that neither had she, but continued, nothing daunted:\\n\\n\"Ah, but he is!\"\\n\\n\"What worries him?\"\\n\\n\"You,\" sighed the lady mournfully. \"\\'Tis the thought of your leaving us.\\nI feel it myself.\"\\n\\n\"Why--\"\\n\\n\"He had hoped you would be with us for a long time--as I had.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis monstrous good of you both, but--\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I do not know what I shall do with Miles when you are gone.\\nHe was so looking forward to having you with him.\"\\n\\n\"Molly--\"\\n\\n\"And, indeed, it has come as a great disappointment to both of us to\\nhear you talk of leaving. Won\\'t you think better of it?\"\\n\\n\"Molly, you overwhelm me.... How can I remain here indefinitely?\"\\n\\n\"If only you would! You don\\'t know how happy it would make us. I declare\\nMiles will worry himself quite ill if you persist in being so unkind.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Molly, you rogue!\"\\n\\nShe could not repress a smile, but checked it almost at once. \"I mean\\nit, Jack.\"\\n\\n\"What! That Miles is worrying himself ill over me? Fie!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps not as bad as that,\" she admitted. \"But, indeed, he is much\\nperturbed ... and, oh! I wish that you would not make us so unhappy.\"\\nShe dabbed at her eyes with a wispy handkerchief, but managed to watch\\nhis face all the same. \"David loves you so, the pet! and Miles is so\\ndelighted to have found you again--and _I_ like you--and--and--and I\\nthink \\'twill be indeed rude and horrid if you do go--besides being so\\nsilly!\"\\n\\n\"Do you, Molly? You make me feel I should be an ungrateful boor to\\nrefuse--\"\\n\\nThe handkerchief was whisked away.\\n\\n\"Then, of course you won\\'t try to refuse! You\\'ll stay? Promise!\"\\n\\n\"I cannot thank you enough--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you nice Jack! Till the autumn? Promise!\"\\n\\n\"Molly, I really--\"\\n\\n\"Promise! I shall cry if you do not!\"\\n\\n\"I cannot! How could I prey upon your hospitality for so--\"\\n\\n\"What rubbish, Jack! As if Miles had not spent months and months at\\nWyncham when you were boys--\"\\n\\n\"That was different--\"\\n\\n\"--when you were boys, and now you are so proud that you refuse to stay\\nthree miserable little months with us--\"\\n\\n\"No, no, Molly; indeed, \\'tis not that!\"\\n\\n\"Confess, if Miles were a bachelor, you would not hesitate?\" He was\\nsilent, nonplussed.\\n\\n\"You see! And just because he has a wife you are disagreeable and proud.\\nYou feel you cannot bear to stay with me--\"\\n\\n\"I swear I do not!\"\\n\\n\"Then why do you refuse?\" she triumphed.\\n\\n\"Molly--really, I--\" He broke off, laughing. \"You little wretch, you\\nleave me nothing to say!\"\\n\\n\"Then you will stay, as I ask?\"\\n\\n\"You are quite sure--\"\\n\\n\"Quite.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you very much, I will stay. \\'Tis monstrous good of you, I vow.\\nWhen you are tired of me, say so.\"\\n\\n\"I will,\" she promised. \"Oh, but we shall do famously! How pleased Miles\\nwill be! By the way,\" she continued, airily, \"I asked the Miss\\nBeauleighs to honour us on Wednesday, but, unfortunately, they could\\nnot. Still, perhaps some other d--\"\\n\\nShe stopped, a little frightened, for he was standing before her,\\ngripping her shoulders in a very elder-brotherly fashion.\\n\\n\"Listen to me, Molly. I know that you have discovered that I love Diana,\\nand I know that you think to be very kind and to bring us together. But\\nI tell you that \\'twill not be kind at all, only very cruel to us both.\\nIf you worry her to come here, I must go. Do you see?\"\\n\\nMolly looked into the stern eyes, and her lip trembled.\\n\\n\"I\\'m very--sorry!\" she faltered.\\n\\nJack drew her arm through his once more.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis nothing to be sorry about; and, indeed, I am very grateful to you\\nfor trying to make me happy. But please do not!\"\\n\\n\"No, I promise I will not. But--but do you think you are being quite\\nfair to--\"\\n\\n\"Molly, tell me this: do you think you are being quite good to disobey\\nyour husband?\"\\n\\nThe blue eyes were dancing. She smiled doubtfully.\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Jack?\"\\n\\n\"Do you tell me that Miles did not expressly forbid you to mention this\\nsubject to me?\"\\n\\nShe pulled her hand away, her mouth forming a soundless\\n\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\\n\"Well--well--well, how horrid of you!\" she cried, and shook her fist at\\nhim. \"I\\'m going now!\"\\n\\nLater, she found her husband in the library, and ran into his arms.\\n\\n\"Do you mind holding me tightly?\" she asked. \"I\\'ve--I\\'ve been put in the\\ncorner!\"\\n\\n\"What?\" O\\'Hara drew her on to his knee.\\n\\n\"Yes--figuratively--by Jack. I think, perhaps, I shouldn\\'t like to marry\\nhim after all!\"\\n\\n\"What has he done?\"\\n\\n\"N-nothing. I\\'m _afraid_,\" polishing one of his buttons with an\\nassiduous finger, \"I\\'m _afraid_ that it was rather my own fault!\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\\n\"Yes--but I only said _very_ little about the Miss Beauleighs, and he\\nsuddenly turned into an iceberg and made me feel like a naughty little\\ngirl. But he is going to stay, all the same; so kiss me, Miles!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVIII\\n\\nENTER CAPTAIN HAROLD LOVELACE\\n\\n\\nAt the end of August, after having spent a moderately quiet summer in\\nthe country, Lady Lavinia was again seized with a longing for town and\\nits attractions. She would not listen to Richard\\'s warnings of the\\natrocious condition of the roads, declaring that she cared not one jot,\\nand go to London she must. After that one protest he desisted, and\\npromised to take her there the following week, secretly counting himself\\nlucky to have kept her so long at Wyncham in comparative cheerfulness of\\nspirits. Lavinia was overjoyed, kissed him again and again, scolded\\nherself for being such a wicked tease, and set about making her\\npreparations for the journey.\\n\\nThe roads proved even worse than Richard had prophesied, and twice the\\ncoach nearly upset, and times without number stuck fast in the mire,\\ncausing the inmates much inconvenience. Carstares rode by the side of\\nthe heavy vehicle, in which were his wife, her maid, her tiny dog, and\\ncountless bandboxes and small parcels. In spite of the worry the\\nconstant stoppages entailed, he quite enjoyed the journey, for Lavinia\\nwas in excellent spirits, and made light of their mishaps, receiving\\neach fresh one with roguish laughter and some witty remark. Even when\\nthe chimney of her bed-chamber, at one of the inns at which they halted,\\nsmoked most vilely, she did not, as Richard quite expected she would,\\nfly into a rage and refuse to spend another moment in the house, but\\nafter looking extremely doleful, cheered up and told dear Dicky that she\\nwould have his room while he should have hers. Then in the morning she\\nwould find him all dried up and _smoked_! In high good humour she went\\ndown to dinner with him, voted the partridges excellent, the pasties\\nquite French, and the wine marvellously tolerable for such an\\nout-of-the-way place, and kept him laughing at her antics until\\nbed-time.\\n\\nThe journey was, of necessity, very slow, not only on account of the bad\\nroads, but because whenever my lady caught sight of wild roses growing\\non the hedges, she must stop to pluck some. Then she and Richard would\\nstroll along for some way, he leading his horse, the coach following at\\na walking pace. All of which was very idyllic, and had the effect of\\nsending Richard to the seventh heaven of content.\\n\\nWhen at length they arrived at Wyncham House, Mayfair, they found that\\nthe servants had arrived a week before, and had made good use of their\\ntime. Never, declared Lavinia, had the house looked so inviting--so\\nspick and span.\\n\\nOne of her black pages proffered a small monkey with much bowing and\\ngrinning, and the murmur of: \"Massa\\'s present.\"\\n\\nLady Lavinia flew to embrace her Dicky. How did he guess that she had\\nfor so long yearned for a monkey? Surely she had but once or twice\\nmentioned it? Oh, he was the very best of husbands! She danced off to\\nher apartments in a state of ecstasy.\\n\\nThe _beau monde_ was returning to town, and when, a few days later,\\nCarstares conducted his wife to Ranelagh, they found the gardens fairly\\ncrowded and very gay. Lamps hung from tree branches, although it was\\nstill quite light; the fiddlers scraped away almost without a pause;\\nfireworks shot up from one end; the summer-houses had all been freshly\\npainted, and the Pavilion was a blaze of light.\\n\\nConsciousness of her beauty and the smartness of her Georgia silk gown,\\nwith its petticoat covered in gold net, considerably added to Lavinia\\'s\\nenjoyment. Her hair she wore powdered and elaborately curled down on\\nboth sides with dainty escalloped lace half concealing it, and a grey\\n_capuchin_ over all. Her tippet was gold-laced to match her petticoat,\\nand to fasten it she wore a brooch composed of clustered rubies. Rubies\\nalso hung in her earrings, which last were of such length that the other\\nladies turned to stare in envy, and the bracelets that she wore over her\\nlong gloves flashed also with the great red stones. She was well-pleased\\nwith Richard\\'s appearance, and reflected that, when he chose, he could\\nbe very fashionable indeed. The claret-coloured velvet he was wearing\\nwas most distinguished, and the gold clocks to his hose quite ravishing.\\n\\nThey had not been in the Gardens ten minutes before a little crowd of\\nmen had gathered around them, professing themselves enraptured to behold\\nthe fair Lady Lavinia once more. One of them fetched her a chair,\\nanother a glass of negus, and the rest hovered eagerly about her.\\n\\nBecomingly flushed with triumph, my lady gave her little hand to Mr.\\nSelwyn, who had been once a very ardent admirer, laughed at his neat\\ncompliment, and declared that he was a dreadful flattering demon, and\\npositively she would not listen to him!\\n\\nSir Gregory Markham, who brought her the negus, she discovered to have\\njust returned from Paris. On hearing this, she broke off in the middle\\nof a conversation with an enchanted French Chevalier and turned to him,\\nraising her china-blue eyes to his face and clasping tight-gloved\\nhands.\\n\\n\"Oh, Sir Gregory! Paris? Then tell me--please, tell me--have you seen my\\ndarling Devil?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, madam,\" responded Markham, handing her the glass he held.\\n\\nShe sipped the negus, and gave it to the Chevalier to take care of.\\n\\n\"I declare, I quite love you then!\" she exclaimed. \"What is he doing,\\nand, oh! _when_ will he return to England?\"\\n\\nSir Gregory smiled.\\n\\n\"How can I say?\" he drawled. \"I fear _monsieur s\\'amuse_!\"\\n\\nShe flirted her fan before her face.\\n\\n\"Dreadful creature!\" she cried. \"How dare you say such things?\"\\n\\n\"Belmanoir?\" inquired Lord D\\'Egmont, twirling his cane.\\n\\n\"Enamoured of the Pompadour, is he not--saving your presence, Lady\\nLavvy!\"\\n\\nLavinia let fall her fan.\\n\\n\"The Pompadour! He had best have a care!\"\\n\\n\"I believe there has already been some unpleasantness between his\\nMajesty and the fair Jeanne on the subject of Devil. Since then she is\\nsupposed to have turned on him a cold shoulder.\"\\n\\n\"_I_ heard \\'twas he wearied of madame,\" said Markham.\\n\\n\"Well, whichever it was, I am glad the episode is closed,\" decided\\nLavinia. \"\\'Tis too dangerous a game to play with Louis\\' mistresses. Oh,\\nmon cher Chevalier! if I had not forgot your presence! But I am sure you\\nsay dreadful ill-natured things of our George, now don\\'t you? Oh, and\\nhave you held my negus all this time? How monstrous good of you! There,\\nI will drink it, and Julian shall take the glass away.... _Voila_!\" She\\nhanded it to D\\'Egmont and rapped Mr. Selwyn\\'s knuckles with her fan,\\nlooking archly up at him as he stood behind her chair.\\n\\n\"Naughty man! Will you have done whispering in my ear? I vow I will not\\nlisten to your impudences! No, nor laugh at them neither! Sir Gregory,\\nyou have given me no answer. When will Tracy return? For the Cavendish\\nrout on Wednesday week? Ah, say yes!\"\\n\\n\"Certainly I will say yes, fair tormentor! But, to tell the truth, Tracy\\nsaid no word of coming to London when I saw him.\"\\n\\nShe pouted.\\n\\n\"Now I hate you, Sir Gregory! And he has been absent since May! Oh,\\nJulian, back already? You shall escort me to the fireworks then. Oh, my\\nfan! Where is it? I know I dropped it on the ground--Selwyn, if you have\\ntaken it--Oh, Dicky, you have it! Thank you! See, I am going with\\nJulian, and you may ogle Mrs. Clive, whom I see walking over there--yes,\\npositively you may, and I shall not be jealous! Very well, Julian, I am\\ncoming! Chevalier, I shall hope to see you at the rout on Wednesday\\nweek, but you must wait upon me before then.\"\\n\\nThe Frenchman brightened.\\n\\n\"Madame is too good. I may then call at Wyncham \\'Ouse? _Vraiment_, I\\nshall but exist until then!\" In a perfectly audible whisper, he confided\\nto Wilding that \"_miladi etait ravissante! mais ravissante!_\"\\n\\nLady Lavinia went off on her gratified cavalier\\'s arm, encountering many\\nbows and much admiration as she passed down the walk, leaving her\\nhusband not to ogle the beautiful Kitty, as she had advised, but to\\nsaunter away in the direction of the Pavilion in company with Tom\\nWilding and Markham.\\n\\nD\\'Egmont guided my lady into one of the winding alleys, and they\\npresently came out on a large lawn, dotted over with people of all\\nconditions. Towards them was coming Lavinia\\'s brother--Colonel Lord\\nRobert Belmanoir--very richly clad and rakish in appearance. When he saw\\nhis sister, a look of surprise came into his florid face, and he made\\nher a sweeping leg.\\n\\n\"\\'Pon my honour--Lavinia!\"\\n\\nMy lady was not fond of her brother, and acknowledged the salutation\\nwith a brief nod.\\n\\n\"I am delighted to see you, Robert,\" she said primly.\\n\\n\"The mere word \\'delighted\\' in no way expresses my sensations,\" replied\\nthe Colonel in the drawling, rather unpleasant voice peculiar both to\\nhim and to the Duke. \"Your servant, D\\'Egmont. I imagined, Lavvy, that\\nyou were in the country?\"\\n\\n\"Richard brought me to town last Tuesday,\" she answered.\\n\\n\"How unwise of him!\" taunted the Colonel. \"Or had he no choice?\"\\n\\nShe tossed her head angrily.\\n\\n\"If you are minded to be disagreeable, Robert, pray do not let me detain\\nyou!\" she flashed.\\n\\nD\\'Egmont was quite unembarrassed by this interchange of civilities. He\\nknew the Belmanoir family too well to be made uncomfortable by their\\nbickerings.\\n\\n\"Shall we leave him?\" he asked Lavinia, smiling.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she pouted. \"He is determined to be unpleasant.\"\\n\\n\"My dear sister! On the contrary, I believe I can offer you some\\namusement. Lovelace is in town.\"\\n\\n\"Captain _Harold_?\" she cried incredulously.\\n\\n\"The same.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Bob!\" Impulsively she withdrew her hand from Julian\\'s arm,\\ntransferring it to the Colonel\\'s. \"I must see him at once! To think he\\nis returned after all these years! Quick, Julian, dear lad--go and find\\nhim--and tell him \\'tis I, Lavinia, who want him! You know him, do you\\nnot? Yes--I thought you did. Send him to me at once!--at once!\"\\n\\nD\\'Egmont looked very crestfallen at having his walk with the goddess\\nthus cut short, but he had perforce to kiss her hand and to obey.\\n\\n\"Yes. I thought you would be pleased,\" remarked Lord Robert, and\\nchuckled. \"Allow me to point out to you that there is a chair--two\\nchairs--in fact, quite a number of chairs--immediately behind you.\"\\n\\nShe sat down, chattering excitedly.\\n\\n\"Why, \\'tis nigh on five years since I saw Harry! Has he changed? Lud!\\nbut he will deem me an old woman! Is he like to be in town for long, I\\nwonder?--Dear me, Bob, look at the two ladies over behind that\\nseat!--Gracious! what extraordinary _coifs_, to be sure! And cherry\\nribbons, too!... Tell me, Bob, where did you meet Harry Lovelace?\"\\n\\nThe Colonel, who, far from attending to her monologue, had been sending\\namorous glances across to a palpably embarrassed girl, who hung on her\\npapa\\'s arm while that gentleman stopped to speak to a stout dowager,\\nbrought his gaze reluctantly back to his sister.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that you say, Lavvy?\"\\n\\n\"How provoking of you not to listen to me! I asked where you met\\nHarold.\"\\n\\n\"Where I met him? Let me see--where did I meet him? Oh, I remember! At\\nthe Cocoa-Tree, a fortnight since.\"\\n\\n\"And he is altered?\"\\n\\n\"Not in any way, dear sister. He is the same mad, reckless rake-hell as\\never. And unmarried.\"\\n\\n\"How delightful! Oh, I shall be so glad to see him again!\"\\n\\n\"You must present him to Richard,\" sneered the Colonel, \"as an old\\nflame.\"\\n\\n\"I must, indeed,\" she agreed, his sarcasm passing over her head. \"Oh, I\\nsee him! Look! Coming across the grass!\"\\n\\nShe rose to meet the tall, fair young Guardsman who came swiftly towards\\nher, curtsying as only Lady Lavinia could curtsy, with such stateliness\\nand coquetry.\\n\\n\"Captain Lovelace!\"--she put forward both her hands.\\n\\nLovelace caught them in his, and bent his head over them so that the\\nsoft, powdered curls of his loose wig fell all about his face.\\n\\n\"Lady Lavinia!--Enchantress!--I can find no words! I am dumb!\"\\n\\n\"And I!\"\\n\\n\"In that case,\" drawled the Colonel, \"you are not like to be very\\nentertaining company. Pray give me leave!\" He bowed and sauntered away\\ndown the path with a peculiarly malicious smile on his lips.\\n\\nLavinia and Lovelace found two chairs, slightly apart from the rest, and\\nsat down, talking eagerly.\\n\\n\"Captain Lovelace, I believe you had forgot me?\" she rallied him.\\n\\n\"Never!\" he answered promptly. \"Not though you well-nigh broke my\\nheart!\"\\n\\n\"No, no! I did not do that. I never meant to hurt you.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head disbelievingly.\\n\\n\"You rejected me to marry some other man: do you say you did not mean\\nto?\"\\n\\n\"You naughty Harry!... You never married yourself?\"\\n\\n\"I?\" The delicate features expressed a species of hurt horror. \"I marry?\\nNo! I was ever faithful to my first love.\"\\n\\nShe unfurled her fan, fluttering it delightedly.\\n\\n\"Oh! Oh! _Always_, Harold? Now speak the truth!\"\\n\\n\"Nearly always,\" he amended.\\n\\n\"Disagreeable man! You admit you had lapses then?\"\\n\\n\"So very trivial, my dear,\" he excused himself. \"And I swear my first\\naction on coming to London was to call at Wyncham House. Imagine my\\ndisappointment--my incalculable gloom (on the top of having already\\ndropped a thousand at faro) when I found the shell void, and Venus--\"\\n\\nShe stopped him, her fan held ready for chastisement.\\n\\n\"Sir! You said your _first_ action was to call upon me!\"\\n\\nHe smiled, shaking back his curls.\\n\\n\"I should have said: my first action of any importance.\"\\n\\n\"You do not deem losing a thousand guineas important?\" she asked\\nwistfully.\\n\\n\"Well--hardly. One must enjoy life, and what\\'s a thousand, after all? I\\nhad my pleasure out of it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes!\" she breathed, her eyes sparkling. \"That is how I think! What\\npleasure can one get if one neither hazards nor spends one\\'s money? Oh,\\nwell!\" She shrugged one shoulder, dismissing the subject.\\n\\n\"Have you seen Tracy of late?\"\\n\\n\"He was at a court ball I attended at Versailles, but I did not have a\\nchance of speaking with him. I heard he was very popular at Paris.\"\\n\\n\"Ay!\" she said proudly. \"He has the French air.... I so desire to see\\nhim again, but I fear he does not think of returning. I know he was\\npromised for the Duchess of Devonshire\\'s rout months ago--before even\\nthe date was fixed, she so dotes on him--but I do not expect to see him\\nthere.\" She sighed and drummed on the ground with her diamond-buckled\\nshoe. \"Harry, I am chilled! Take me to the Pavilion! I doubt they are\\ndancing--and Dicky will be there.\"\\n\\n\"Dicky?\" he repeated. \"Dicky! Lavinia, do not tell me there is another\\nclaimant to your heart?\"\\n\\n\"Wicked, indelicate creature! \\'Tis my husband!\"\\n\\n\"Your _husband_! Enfin--\"\\n\\nShe cast him a sidelong glance of mingled coquetry and reproof.\\n\\n\"Your mind is at rest again, I trust?\"\\n\\n\"Of course! A husband? Pooh, a bagatelle, no more!\"\\n\\n\"My husband is not a bagatelle!\" she laughed. \"I am very fond of him.\"\\n\\n\"This grows serious,\" he frowned. \"\\'Tis very unfashionable, surely?\"\\n\\nShe met his teasing eyes and cast down her lashes.\\n\\n\"Captain Lovelace, you may take me to the Pavilion.\"\\n\\n\"Sweet tormentor, not until you cease so to misname me.\"\\n\\n\"Harold, I am indeed chilly!\" she said plaintively and snatched her hand\\nfrom his lips. \"No, no! People will stare--look, there is my odious\\nbrother returning! I declare I will not stay to listen to his hateful,\\nsneering remarks!... Come!\"\\n\\nThey walked across the grass together, keeping up a running fire of\\nraillery, punctuated on his side by extravagant compliments filled with\\nclassical allusions, all more or less erroneous, and on hers by\\ndelighted little laughs and mock scoldings. So they came to the\\nPavilion, where the musicians fiddled for those who wished to dance, and\\nwhere most of the company had assembled now that it was growing chilly\\nwithout. Down one end of the hall, card-tables were set out, where\\nmembers of both sexes diced and gambled, drinking glasses of burgundy or\\nnegus, the men toasting the ladies, and very often the ladies returning\\nthe toasts with much archness and low curtseying.\\n\\nLavinia cast off her _capuchin_ and plumed her feathers, giving a\\nsurreptitious shake to her ruched skirts and smoothing her ruffles. She\\nrustled forward with great stateliness, fan unfurled, head held high,\\nher gloved fingers resting lightly on Lovelace\\'s velvet-clad arm.\\nRichard, hearing the little stir caused by her entry, glanced up, and\\nperceived her. He did not recognise her companion, but the sparkle in\\nher eyes and the happy curve to her full lips were quite enough to tell\\nhim that it was someone whom she was very contented to have met. He had\\nample opportunity for studying Lovelace as the good-looking pair drew\\nnear, and he could not but admire the delicate, handsome face with the\\ngrey eyes that held a laugh in them, the pleasure-loving, well-curved\\nmouth, and the chin that spoke of determination. Here was not one of\\nLavinia\\'s lisping, painted puppy-dogs, for in spite of the effeminate\\ncurls, it was easy to see that this man had character and a will of his\\nown, and, above all, a great charm of manner. He saw Lavinia blush and\\nrap the Captain\\'s knuckles in answer to some remark, and his heart sank.\\nHe rose and came to meet them.\\n\\nLady Lavinia smiled sweetly upon him, and patted his arm with a\\npossessive little air.\\n\\n\"Dicky dear, I have found an old friend--a very old friend! Is it not\\nagreeable? Captain Lovelace--Mr. Carstares.\"\\n\\nThe two men bowed, Richard with reluctancy, the Captain with easy\\n_bonhomie_.\\n\\n\"Sir, I claim to be a worshipper at the shrine of which you, I believe,\\nare High Priest!\" he said impudently, and bowed again, this time to my\\nlady.\\n\\n\"You are one of many, sir,\" smiled Richard.\\n\\nLady Devereux came tripping up to them, and kissed Lavinia with a great\\nshow of affection.\\n\\n\"My dearest life! My sweet Lavinia!\"\\n\\nLady Lavinia presented a powdered cheek.\\n\\n\"Dearest Fanny, how charming to see you again!\" she cooed. Through her\\nlashes she gazed at her friend\\'s enormous headdress, with its rolls of\\npowdered curls and the imitation flowers perched upon the top of the\\nerection.\\n\\n\"But, my angel!\" exclaimed Lady Fanny, stepping back to view her,\\n\"surely you have been ill?\"\\n\\n\"How strange!\" smiled Lavinia. \"I was about to ask you that same\\nquestion, my dear! \\'Tis age, I doubt not. Do we both look such dreadful\\nhags?\" She turned her bewitching little countenance to the men, and\\nsmiled appealingly.\\n\\nCompliments showered upon her, and Lady Devereux, who was conscious that\\nher own sallow countenance, in spite of rouge and powder, must appear\\neven more sallow beside Lavinia\\'s pink-and-whiteness, flushed in\\nannoyance and turned away, begging her dearest Lavvy to come to the faro\\nwith her. But Lavinia, it appeared, was going to watch the dicing at\\nRichard\\'s table: she vowed she should bring him monstrous good luck.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t doubt it, my dear,\" replied her husband, \"but I am not playing\\nto-night. Will you not take your luck to Bob?\" He nodded to where the\\nColonel was lounging, dice-box in hand.\\n\\nLavinia pouted.\\n\\n\"No, I want you to play!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis of no avail, Lady Lavinia!\" drawled Sir Gregory. \"Richard is the\\nvery devil to-night.\"\\n\\nSelwyn, rattling his dice, paused, and looked round at Markham with a\\nface of innocent surprise. Then he turned slowly and stared at\\nCarstares\\' grave, almost stern countenance, with even more surprise. He\\nstarted to rattle the dice again, and shifted back to face his opponent,\\nwith pursed lips.\\n\\n\"Is he?\" he inquired with studied depression.\\n\\nEven Lavinia joined in the general laugh, not so much at the wit\\'s words\\nas at his comic expression, and the extreme deliberation with which he\\nhad enacted the little scene.\\n\\nSomeone cried a bet to Lovelace, which was promptly accepted, and\\nLavinia\\'s eyes glowed afresh as she followed the Captain to a table.\\n\\nRichard went to fetch her some refreshment, and on his return, found her\\nleaning over Lovelace\\'s chair, her hand on his shoulder, eagerly casting\\nthe dice on to the table. He was in time to see her clap her hands and\\nto hear her cry of: \"My luck! Oh, my luck is in! I will throw again!\"\\n\\nGlancing round she caught sight of her husband, and her face fell.\\n\\n\"Do you _mind_, Dicky?\" she pleaded.\\n\\nHe did mind, but he could not appear churlish before all these men; so\\nhe laughed and shook his head, and went to her elbow to watch her play.\\n\\nWhen she at length ceased, her luck had run out, and she had lost her\\nmuch-prized ruby earring to Mr. Selwyn, who placed it carefully in his\\nvest pocket, vowing he should wear it next his heart for ever. Then, and\\nthen only, did she consent to leave the gaming tables for the dancing\\nhall, and for another hour Richard had the felicity of watching her\\ntread the minuet with various young bloods, but most often with her\\nnew-found Harry Lovelace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIX\\n\\nTHE REAPPEARANCE OF HIS GRACE OF ANDOVER\\n\\n\\nIt seemed to Richard in the days that followed, that Captain Lovelace\\nwas never out of his house. If he went to his wife\\'s boudoir, there was\\nLovelace, hanging over her while she played upon the spinet or glanced\\nthrough the pages of the _Rambler_. If Lavinia went to a ball or\\nmasquerade, the Captain was always amongst the favoured ones admitted to\\nher chamber for the express purpose of watching her don her gown and\\njudiciously place her patches. If Carstares begged his wife\\'s company\\none morning, she was full of regrets: Harry was calling to take her to\\nVauxhall or to Spring Gardens. When he entered his door, the first sight\\nthat met his eyes was the Captain\\'s amber-clouded cane and point-edged\\nhat; and when he looked out of the window, it was more often to see a\\nchair draw up at the house and Lovelace alight. After patiently enduring\\na week of his continued presence, Carstares remonstrated with his wife:\\nshe must not encourage her friend to spend all his time at Grosvenor\\nSquare. At first she had looked reproachful, and then she inquired his\\nreason. His reluctant answer was that it was not seemly. At that her\\neyes had opened wide, and she demanded to know what could be more seemly\\nthan the visits of such an old friend? With a gleam of humour, Richard\\nreplied that it was not Captain Harold\\'s age that he objected to, but,\\non the contrary, his youth. On which she accused him of being jealous.\\nIt was true enough, but he indignantly repudiated the suggestion. Very\\nwell, then, he was merely stupid! He must not be cross; Harry was her\\nvery good friend, and did not Richard admire the new device for her\\nhair? Richard was not to be cajoled: did she clearly understand that\\nLovelace\\'s visits must cease? She only understood one thing, and that\\nwas that Dicky was marvellous ill-tempered and ridiculous to-day. And he\\nmust not tease her! Yes, she would be very good, but so must he! And now\\nshe was going shopping, and she would require at least twenty guineas.\\n\\nIn spite of her promise to \"be good,\" she made no attempt to discourage\\nLovelace\\'s attentions, always smiling charmingly upon him and beckoning\\nhim to her side.\\n\\nIt was the morning of the Duchess of Devonshire\\'s rout that Carstares\\nagain broached the subject. My lady was in bed, her fair hair unpowdered\\nand streaming all about her shoulders, her chocolate on a small table at\\nher side and countless _billets doux_ from admirers scattered on the\\nsheet. In her hand she held a bouquet of white roses with a card\\nattached bearing, in bold, sprawling characters, the initials \"H. L.\"\\nPerhaps it was the sight of those incriminating letters that roused\\nRichard\\'s anger. At all events, with a violence quite unlike his usual\\ngentle politeness, he snatched the flowers from her hand, and sent them\\nwhizzing into a corner.\\n\\n\"Let there be an end to all this folly!\" he cried.\\n\\nLavinia raised herself on one elbow, astonished.\\n\\n\"H-how _dare_ you?\" she gasped.\\n\\n\"It has come to that!\" he answered. \"How dare I, your husband, try to\\ncontrol your actions in any way? I tell you, Lavinia, I have had enough\\nof your antics, and I will not longer put up with them!\"\\n\\n\"You--you--What in heaven\\'s name ails you, Richard?\"\\n\\n\"This! I will not countenance that puppy\\'s invasion of my house!\" He\\nmade a furious gesture towards the wilted bouquet.\\n\\n\"Neither will I permit you to make yourself the talk of London through\\nhim!\"\\n\\n\"I? I? _I_ make myself the talk of London? How dare you? Oh! how dare\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"I beg you will cease that foolishness. There is no question of my\\ndaring. How dare _you_ disobey me, as you have been doing all this past\\nweek?\"\\n\\nShe cowered away from him.\\n\\n\"Dicky!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis very well to cry \\'Dicky,\\' and to smile, but I have experienced\\nthat before. Sometimes I think you are utterly without heart!--a\\nselfish, vain, extravagant woman!\"\\n\\nThe childish lips trembled. Lady Lavinia buried her face in the pillows,\\nsobbing.\\n\\nCarstares\\' face softened.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, my dear. Mayhap that was unjust.\"\\n\\n\"And cruel! And cruel!\"\\n\\n\"And cruel. Forgive me.\"\\n\\nShe twined white, satiny arms about his neck.\\n\\n\"You did not _mean_ it?\"\\n\\n\"No. I mean that I will not allow Lovelace to dangle after you,\\nhowever.\"\\n\\nShe flung away from him.\\n\\n\"You have no right to speak like that. I knew Harry long before I ever\\nset eyes on _you_!\"\\n\\nHe winced.\\n\\n\"You infer that he is more to you than I am?\"\\n\\n\"No! Though you try to make me hate you. No! I love you best. But I will\\nnot send Harry away!\"\\n\\n\"Not if I order it?\"\\n\\n\"Order it? Order it? No! No! A thousand times no!\"\\n\\n\"I do order it!\"\\n\\n\"And I refuse to listen to you!\"\\n\\n\"By God, madam, you need a lesson!\" he flamed. \"I am minded to take you\\nback to Wyncham this very day! And I promise you that, an you do not\\nobey me in this, to Wyncham you _shall_ go!\" He stamped out of the room\\nas he spoke, and she sank back amongst her pillows, white and trembling\\nwith fury.\\n\\nAs soon as she was dressed, she flounced downstairs, bent on finishing\\nthe quarrel. But Carstares had gone out some time since, and was not\\nexpected to return until late. For a moment Lavinia was furious, but the\\ntimely arrival of a box from her mantua-maker\\'s chased away the frowns\\nand wreathed her face in smiles.\\n\\nRichard did not return until it was time to prepare for the rout, and on\\nentering the house he went straight to his chamber, putting himself into\\nthe hands of his valet. He submitted to the delicate tinting of his\\nfinger-nails, the sprinkling of his linen with rosewater and the\\nstencilling of his brows. He was arrayed in puce and gold, rings slipped\\non to his fingers, his legs coaxed into hose with marvellous clocks\\nsplashed on their sides, and a diamond buckle placed above the large\\nblack bow of his tie-wig. Then, powdered, painted and patched, he went\\nslowly across to his wife\\'s room.\\n\\nLavinia, who had by now quite forgotten the morning\\'s _contretemps_,\\ngreeted him with a smile. She sat before the mirror in her under-gown,\\nwith a loose _déshabillé_ thrown over her shoulders. The _coiffeur_ had\\ndeparted, and her hair, thickly powdered, was dressed high above her\\nhead over cushions, twisted into curls over her ears and allowed to fall\\nin more curls over her shoulders. On top of the creation were poised\\nostrich feathers, scarlet and white, and round her throat gleamed a\\ngreat necklet of diamonds. The room was redolent of some heavy perfume;\\ndiscarded ribbons, laces, slippers and gloves strewed the floor; over\\nthe back of a chair hung a brilliant scarlet domino, and tenderly laid\\nout on the bed was her gown, a mass of white satin and brocade, with\\nfull ruffles over the hips and quantities of foaming lace falling from\\nthe corsage and from the short sleeves. Beside it reposed her fan, her\\nsoft lace gloves, her mask and her tiny reticule.\\n\\nCarstares gingerly sat down on the extreme edge of a chair and watched\\nthe maid tint his wife\\'s already perfect cheeks.\\n\\n\"I shall break hearts to-night, shall I not?\" she asked gaily, over her\\nshoulder.\\n\\n\"I do not doubt it,\" he answered shortly.\\n\\n\"And you, Dicky?\" She turned round to look at him. \"Puce... \\'tis not the\\ncolour I should have chosen, but \\'tis well enough. A new wig, surely?\"\\n\\n\"Ay.\"\\n\\nHer eyes questioned his coldness, and she suddenly remembered the events\\nof the morning. So he was sulky? Very well! Monsieur should see!\\n\\nSomeone knocked at the door; the maid went to open it.\\n\\n\"Sir Douglas Faversham, Sir Gregory Markham, Moosso le Chevalier and\\nCaptain Lovelace are below, m\\'lady.\"\\n\\nA little devil prompted Lavinia.\\n\\n\"Oh, la-la! So many? Well, I cannot see all, \\'tis certain. Admit Sir\\nGregory and Captain Lovelace.\"\\n\\nLouisa communicated this to the lackey and shut the door.\\n\\nRichard bit his lip angrily.\\n\\n\"Are you sure I am not _de trop_?\" he asked, savagely sarcastic.\\n\\nLady Lavinia cast aside her _déshabillé_ and stood up.\\n\\n\"Oh, \\'tis no matter--I am ready for my gown, Louisa.\"\\n\\nThere came more knocking at the door, and this time it was Carstares who\\nrose to open it.\\n\\nThere entered Markham, heavily handsome in crimson and gold, and\\nLovelace, his opposite, fair and delicately pretty in palest blue and\\nsilver. As usual, he wore his loose wig, and in it sparkled three\\nsapphire pins.\\n\\nHe made my lady a marvellous leg.\\n\\n\"I am prostrated by your beauty, fairest!\"\\n\\nSir Gregory was eyeing Lavinia\\'s white slippers through his quizzing\\nglass.\\n\\n\"Jewelled heels, \\'pon my soul!\" he drawled.\\n\\nShe pirouetted gracefully, her feet flashing as they caught the light.\\n\\n\"Was it not well thought on?\" she demanded. \"But I must not waste\\ntime--the dress! Now, Markham--now Harry--you will see the creation!\"\\n\\nLovelace sat down on a chair, straddle-wise, his arms over the back, and\\nhis chin sunk in his hands. Markham leant against the _garde-robe_ and\\nwatched through his glass.\\n\\nWhen the dress was at last arranged, the suggested improvements in the\\nmatter of lace, ribbons, and the adjustment of a brooch thoroughly\\ndiscussed, bracelets fixed on her arms and the flaming domino draped\\nabout her, it was full three-quarters of an hour later, and Carstares\\nwas becoming impatient. It was not in his nature to join with the two\\nmen in making fulsome compliments, and their presence at the toilette\\nfilled him with annoyance. He hated that Lavinia should admit them, but\\nit was the _mode_, and he knew he must bow the head under it.\\n\\nMy lady was at last ready to start; her gilded chair awaited her in the\\nlight of the _flambeaux_ at the door, and with great difficulty she\\nmanaged to enter it, taking absurd pains that her silks should not\\ncrush, nor the nodding plumes of her huge head-dress become disordered\\nby unseemly contact with the roof. Then she found that she had left her\\nfan in her room, and Lovelace and Markham must needs vie with one\\nanother in the fetching of it. While they wrangled wittily for the\\nhonour, Richard went quietly indoors and presently emerged with the\\npainted chicken-skin, just as Lovelace was preparing to ascend the\\nsteps. At last Lavinia was shut in and the bearers picked up the poles.\\nOff went the little cavalcade down the long square, the chair in the\\nmiddle. Lovelace walked close beside it on the right, and Richard and\\nMarkham on the left. So they proceeded through the uneven streets,\\ncarefully picking their way through the dirtier parts, passing other\\nchairs and pedestrians, all coming from various quarters into South\\nAudley Street. They were remarkably silent: Markham from habitual\\nlaziness, Lovelace because he sensed Richard\\'s antagonism, and Richard\\nhimself on account of his extremely worried state of mind. In fact,\\nuntil they reached Curzon Street no one spoke, and then it was only\\nMarkham, who, glancing behind him at the shuttered windows of the great\\ncorner house, casually remarked that Chesterfield was still at Wells. An\\nabsent assent came from Carstares, and the conversation came to an end.\\n\\nIn Clarges Street they were joined by Sir John Fortescue, an austere\\npatrician, and although some years his senior, a close friend of\\nRichard\\'s. They fell behind the chair, and Fortescue took Richard\\'s\\nproffered arm.\\n\\n\"I did not see you at White\\'s to-day, John?\"\\n\\n\"No. I had some business with my lawyer. I suppose you did not stumble\\nacross my poor brother?\"\\n\\n\"Frank? I did not--but why the \\'poor\\'?\"\\n\\nFortescue shrugged slightly.\\n\\n\"I think the lad is demented,\" he said. \"He was to have made one of\\nMarch\\'s supper-party last night, but at four o\\'clock received a\\ncommunication from heaven knows whom which threw him into a state of\\nunrest. What must he do but hurry off without a word of explanation.\\nSince then I have not set eyes on him, but his man tells me he went to\\nmeet a friend. Damned unusual of him is all I have to say.\"\\n\\n\"Very strange. Do you expect to see him to-night?\"\\n\\n\"I should hope so! My dear Carstares, who is the man walking by your\\nlady\\'s chair?\"\\n\\n\"Markham?\"\\n\\n\"The other.\"\\n\\n\"Lovelace.\"\\n\\n\"Lovelace? And who the devil is he?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot tell you--beyond a captain in the Guards.\"\\n\\n\"That even is news to me. I saw him at Goosetree\\'s the other night, and\\nwondered. Somewhat of a rake-hell, I surmise.\"\\n\\n\"I daresay. I do not like him.\"\\n\\nThey were entering the gates of Devonshire House now, and had to part\\ncompany, for the crush was so great that it was almost impossible to\\nkeep together. Carstares stayed by Lavinia\\'s chair, and the other men\\nmelted away into the crowd. Chairs jostled one another in the effort to\\nget to the door, town coaches rolled up, and having let down their fair\\nburdens, passed out again slowly, pushing through the throng.\\n\\nWhen the Carstares\\' chair at last drew near the house, it was quite a\\nquarter of an hour later. The ball-room was already full and a blaze of\\nriotous colour. Lavinia was almost immediately borne off by an\\ninfatuated youth for whom she cherished a motherly affection that would\\nhave caused the unfortunate to tear his elegant locks, had he known it.\\n\\nRichard distinguished Lord Andrew Belmanoir, one of a group of bucks\\ngathered about the newest beauty, Miss Gunning, who, with her sister\\nElizabeth, had taken fashionable London by storm. Andrew wore a mask,\\nbut he was quite unmistakable by his length of limb and carelessly\\nrakish appearance.\\n\\nWilding, across the room, beckoned to Richard, and on his approach,\\ndragged him to the card-room to play at lansquenet with March, Selwyn\\nand himself.\\n\\nCarstares found the Earl in great good-humour, due, so Selwyn remarked,\\nto the finding of an opera singer even more lovely than the last. From\\nlansquenet they very soon passed to dice and betting, with others who\\nstrolled up to the table. Then Carstares excused himself and went back\\nto the ball-room. He presently found himself by the side of one Isabella\\nFanshawe, a sprightly widow, greatly famed for her wittiness and good\\nlooks. Carstares had met her but once before, and was now rather\\nsurprised that she motioned him to her side, patting the couch with an\\ninviting, much be-ringed hand.\\n\\n\"Come and sit by me, Mr. Carstares. I have wanted to speak with you this\\nlong time.\" She lowered her mask as she spoke and closely scrutinised\\nhis face with her bright, humorous eyes.\\n\\n\"Why, madam, I am flattered,\" bowed Richard.\\n\\nShe cut him short.\\n\\n\"I am not in the mood for compliments, sir. Nor am I desirous of making\\nor hearing clever speeches. You are worrying me.\"\\n\\nRichard sat down, intrigued and attracted by this downright little\\nwoman.\\n\\n\"I, madam?\"\\n\\n\"You, sir. That is, your face worries me.\" Seeing his surprise, she\\nlaughed, fanning herself. \"\\'Tis comely enough, I grant you! I mean there\\nis such a strong likeness to--a friend of mine.\"\\n\\nRichard smiled politely and relieved her of the fan.\\n\\n\"Indeed, madam?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I knew--this other gentleman in Vienna, three years ago. I should\\njudge him younger than you, I think. His eyes were blue, but very\\nsimilar to yours. His nose was almost identical with yours, but the\\nmouth--n-no. Yet the whole expression--\" She broke off, noticing her\\ncompanion\\'s sudden pallor. \"But you are unwell, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, madam, no! What was your friend\\'s name?\"\\n\\n\"Ferndale,\" she answered. \"Anthony Ferndale.\"\\n\\nThe fan stopped its swaying for a moment.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"Do you know him?\" she inquired eagerly.\\n\\n\"Many years ago, madam, I was--acquainted with him. Can you tell me--was\\nhe in good spirits when last you saw him?\"\\n\\nShe pursed her lips thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"If you mean was he gay, was he witty--yes. But sometimes I thought--Mr.\\nCarstares, when he was silent, his eyes were so sad--! Indeed, I do not\\nknow why I tell you this.\"\\n\\n\"You may be sure, madam, your confidence is safe with me. I had--a great\\nregard for this gentleman.\" He opened and shut her fan as he spoke,\\nfidgeting with the slender sticks. \"You, too, were interested in him,\\nmadam?\"\\n\\n\"I do not think ever anyone knew him and was not, sir. It was something\\nin his manner, his personality--I cannot explain--that endeared him to\\none. And he once--aided me--when I was in difficulties.\"\\n\\nRichard, remembering scraps of gossip concerning the widow\\'s past,\\nmerely bowed his head.\\n\\nShe was silent for a time, staring down at her hands, but presently she\\nlooked up smiling, and took her fan away from him.\\n\\n\"I cannot abide a fidget, sir!\" she told him. \"And I see Lord\\nFotheringham approaching. I am promised to him this dance.\" She rose,\\nbut Richard detained her.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Fanshawe, will you permit me to call upon you? I would hear more\\nof--your friend. You, mayhap, think it strange--but--\"\\n\\n\"No,\" she answered. \"I do not. Certainly call upon me, sir. I lodge in\\nMount Street with my sister--No. 16.\"\\n\\n\"I protest, madam, you are too good--\"\\n\\n\"Again, no. I have told you, I like a man to talk as a man and not as an\\naffected woman. I shall be pleased to welcome you.\"\\n\\nShe curtsied and went away on the Viscount\\'s arm.\\n\\nAt the same moment a voice at Richard\\'s elbow drawled:\\n\\n\"Do I see you at the vivacious widow\\'s feet, my good Dick?\"\\n\\nCarstares turned to face his brother-in-law, Colonel Belmanoir.\\n\\n\"Is not all London?\" he smiled.\\n\\n\"Oh, no! Not since the beautiful Gunnings\\' arrival. But I admit she is a\\ndainty piece. And Lavinia? Will she break her heart, I wonder?\" He\\nlaughed beneath his breath as he saw Richard\\'s eyes flash.\\n\\n\"I trust not,\" replied Carstares. \"Are you all here to-night?\"\\n\\n\"Our illustrious head is absent, I believe. Andrew is flirting with the\\nFletcher girl in the Blue Salon; I am here, and Lavinia is amusing\\nherself with Lovelace. Yes, Richard, Lovelace! Be careful!\" With another\\nsneering laugh he walked on, bowing to Elizabeth Gunning, who passed by\\non the arm of her partner, his Grace of Hamilton, most palpably _épris_.\\n\\nAt that moment two late-comers entered the room and made their way\\ntowards their hostess, who appeared delighted to see them, especially\\nthe taller of the two, whose hand she slapped with good-humoured\\nraillery. The shorter gentleman wore no mask, and the Colonel recognised\\nFrank Fortescue. His eyes travelled to the other, who, unlike most of\\nthe men who only held their masks, had fastened his across his eyes, and\\nthey widened in surprise. The purple domino, worn carelessly open,\\nrevealed black satin encrusted with silver and diamonds. The natural\\nhair was raven-black, the nostrils were pinched and the lips thin.\\n\\n\"The Devil!\" ejaculated Robert, and strolled over to him.\\n\\nFortescue walked away when he saw who approached, and his Grace of\\nAndover turned slowly towards his brother.\\n\\n\"I rather thought you were in Paris,\" yawned the colonel.\\n\\n\"I am always sorry to disillusion you,\" bowed his Grace.\\n\\n\"Not at all; I am transported with joy at seeing you. As is Lavinia, it\\nappears.\"\\n\\nLady Lavinia, on recognising his Grace, had dropped her partner\\'s hand\\nand fled incontinent towards him.\\n\\n\"You, Tracy!\" She clasped delighted hands on his arm.\\n\\n\"This is very touching,\" sneered Robert. \"It only needs Andrew to\\ncomplete the happy reunion. Pray excuse me!\"\\n\\n\"With pleasure,\" replied the Duke gently, and bowed as if to a stranger.\\n\\n\"He grows tedious,\" he remarked, as soon as the Colonel was out of\\nearshot.\\n\\n\"Oh, Bob! I take no account of _him_! But, Tracy, how is it you have\\ncome to-day? I thought--\"\\n\\n\"My dear Lavinia, do I wear an air of mystery? I imagined you knew I was\\npromised to Dolly Cavendish to-night?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but--oh, what matters it? I am so charmed to see you again, dear!\"\\n\\n\"You flatter me, Lavinia.\"\\n\\n\"And now that you have come, I want to hear why you ever went! Tracy,\\ntake me into the room behind us. I know \\'tis empty.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, child, as you will.\" He held back the curtain for her and\\nfollowed her into the deserted chamber.\\n\\n\"You want to know why I went?\" he began, seating himself at her side. \"I\\ncounsel you, my dear, to cast your mind back to the spring--at Bath.\"\\n\\n\"Your _affaire_! Of course! So the lady proved unkind?\"\\n\\n\"No. But I bungled it.\"\\n\\n\"_You_? Tell me at once!--at once!\"\\n\\nHis Grace stretched out his leg and surveyed his shoe-buckle through\\nhalf-closed lids.\\n\\n\"I had arranged everything,\" he said, \"and all would have been well but\\nfor an interfering young jackanapes who chanced along the track and saw\\nfit to espouse Madam Diana\\'s cause.\" He paused. \"He tripped me up by\\nsome trick, and then--_que veux-tu_?\"\\n\\n\"Who was it?\"\\n\\n\"How should I know? At first he seemed familiar. At all events, he knew\\nme. He may be dead by now. I hope he is.\"\\n\\n\"Gracious! Did you wound him?\"\\n\\n\"I managed to fire at him, but he was too quick, and the bullet took him\\nin the shoulder. It may, however, have been mortal.\"\\n\\n\"And so you went to Paris?\"\\n\\n\"Ay. To forget her.\"\\n\\n\"And have you forgotten?\"\\n\\n\"I have not. She is never out of my thoughts. I plan again.\"\\n\\nHis sister sighed.\\n\\n\"She is then more beautiful than the Pompadour?\" she asked meaningly.\\n\\nTracy turned his head.\\n\\n\"The Pompadour?\"\\n\\n\"Ay! We heard you contrived to amuse yourself in a pretty fashion,\\nTracy!\"\\n\\n\"Really? I had no idea people were so interested in my affairs. But\\n\\'amuse\\' is an apt word.\"\\n\\n\"Ah? You were not then _épris_?\"\\n\\n\"I? With that low-born cocotte? My dear Lavinia!\"\\n\\nShe laughed at his haughty tone.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve not always been so nice, Tracy! But what of your Diana? An you\\nare so infatuated, you had best wed her.\"\\n\\n\"Why, so I think.\"\\n\\nLady Lavinia gasped.\\n\\n\"Tracy! You do not mean it? Goodness me, but a marriage!\"\\n\\n\"Why not, Lavinia?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, a respectable married man, forsooth! And how long will the passion\\nlast?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot be expected to foretell that, surely? I hope, for ever.\"\\n\\n\"And you\\'ll tie yourself up for the sake of one chit? Lud!\"\\n\\n\"I can conceive a worse fate for a man.\"\\n\\n\"Can you? Well, tell me more! \\'Tis monstrous exciting. Do you intend to\\ncourt her?\"\\n\\n\"At this stage of the proceedings? That were somewhat tactless, my dear.\\nI must abduct her, but I must be more careful. Once I have her, I can\\npropitiate Papa.\"\\n\\n\"Tracy, \\'tis the maddest scheme ever I heard! What will the others say?\"\\n\\n\"Do you really suppose I care?\"\\n\\n\"No, I suppose not. Oh, will not Bob be furious, though!\"\\n\\n\"It were almost worth while--just for the sake of foiling him. He would\\nso like to succeed me. But I really do not think he must.\" His elbow was\\non his knee, his chin in his hand, and a peculiar smile on his lips.\\n\"Can you imagine him stepping into my ducal shoes, Lavinia?\"\\n\\n\"Very easily!\" she cried. \"Oh, yes, yes, Tracy! Marry the girl!\"\\n\\n\"If she will.\"\\n\\n\"Why, \\'tis not like you to underrate your persuasive powers!\"\\n\\nHis Grace\\'s thin nostrils wrinkled up in a curious grimace.\\n\\n\"I believe one cannot force a girl to the altar,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Unless she is a fool, she\\'ll have you.\"\\n\\n\"Her parent would be influenced by my dukedom, but she, no. Not even if\\nshe knew of it.\"\\n\\n\"Does she not know?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not. I am Mr. Everard.\"\\n\\n\"How wise of you, Tracy! So you\\'ve nought to fear?\"\\n\\n\"Fear?\" He snapped his fingers. \"I?\"\\n\\nThe heavy curtain swung noiselessly aside. Richard Carstares stood in\\nthe opening.\\n\\nTracy turned his head and scrutinised him languidly. Then he put up his\\nhand and removed his mask.\\n\\n\"Is it possible the husband scented an intrigue? It seems I am doomed to\\ndisappoint to-night.\"\\n\\nLavinia, smarting from her morning\\'s wrongs, laughed savagely.\\n\\n\"More probable he mistook me for someone else!\" she snapped.\\n\\nRichard bowed, his hand on the curtain. He had shown no surprise at\\nseeing the Duke.\\n\\n\"Far more probable, my dear. I thought you Lady Charlwood! Pray give me\\nleave.\" He was gone on the word.\\n\\nTracy replaced his mask, chuckling.\\n\\n\"Honest Dick grows cold, eh? But what a snub, Lavinia!\"\\n\\nHer little hand clenched.\\n\\n\"Oh, how dare he! How dare he insult me so?\"\\n\\n\"My dear sister, in all justice to him, you must admit the boot was\\nrather on the other leg.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I know--I know! But he is so provoking!--so jealous!--so\\nunreasonable!\"\\n\\n\"Jealous? And why?\"\\n\\nWith an impatient twitch at her petticoat she made answer, not looking\\nat him.\\n\\n\"Oh, I do not know! Nor he! Take me back to the ball-room.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, my dear.\" He rose and led her out. \"I shall do myself the\\nhonour of waiting on you--to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Yes? How delightful \\'twill be! Come to dine, Tracy! Richard is promised\\nto the Fortescues.\"\\n\\n\"In that case, I have much pleasure in accepting your invitation.... In\\nheaven\\'s name, who is this?\"\\n\\nLovelace was bearing down upon them.\\n\\n\"Lavinia! I have been seeking you everywhere!--ah--your servant, sir!\"\\nHe bowed to his Grace, and took Lavinia\\'s hand.\\n\\n\"Oh--oh, Harold!--you remember Tracy?\" she said nervously.\\n\\n\"Tracy! I did not know you masked! I saw you last in Paris.\"\\n\\n\"Really? I regret I was not aware of your presence. It is a good many\\nyears since I had the honour of seeing you.\"\\n\\n\"Five,\" nodded Lovelace, and sent a smiling, amorous glance at Lavinia.\\n\\n\"Exactly,\" bowed his Grace. \"You have, I perceive, renewed your\\nacquaintance with my sister.\"\\n\\nWhen they were gone he caressed his chin, thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"Lovelace ... and Richard is so jealous, so unreasonable. Now I do hope\\nLavinia will do nothing indiscreet--Yes, Frank, I was talking to myself;\\na bad habit.\"\\n\\nFortescue, who had come up behind him, took his arm.\\n\\n\"A sign of lunacy, my dear. Jim Cavendish demands you.\"\\n\\n\"Does he? May I ask why?\"\\n\\n\"He is in the card-room. There is some bet on, I believe.\"\\n\\n\"In that case I shall have to go. You had best accompany me, Frank.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. You have seen Lady Lavinia?\"\\n\\nBeneath the mask his Grace\\'s eyes narrowed.\\n\\n\"I have seen Lavinia. Also I have seen an old friend--Lovelace by name.\"\\n\\n\"The captain with the full-bottomed wig? Your friend, you say?\"\\n\\n\"Did I say so? I should correct myself: a friend of my sister\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed? Yes, I believe I have seen him in her company.\"\\n\\nTracy smiled enigmatically.\\n\\n\"I daresay.\"\\n\\n\"And what of you, Tracy?\"\\n\\n\"Well? _What_ of me?\"\\n\\n\"You told me this morning that you had at last fallen in love. It is\\ntrue? You are honestly in love?\"\\n\\n\"Honestly? How do I know? I only know that I have felt this passion for\\nfour months, and now it is stronger than ever. It sounds like love.\"\\n\\n\"Then, an she is a good woman, I hope she will consent to take you, such\\nas you are, and make of you such as she can!\"\\n\\n\"Now that is very neat, Frank. I congratulate you. Of course she will\\ntake me; as to the rest--I think not.\"\\n\\n\"Tare an\\' ouns, Tracy! but an that is the tone you take with her, she\\'ll\\nhave none of you!\"\\n\\n\"I have never found it unsuccessful.\"\\n\\n\"With your common trollops, no! But if your Diana is a lady, she will\\ndispatch you about your business! Woo her, man! Forget your own damned\\nimportance, for I think you will need to humble yourself to the dust if\\nall that you tell me has passed between you is true!\"\\n\\nThey had paused outside the card-room. A curtain shut it off from the\\nball-room, and with his hand on it, Tracy stared arrogantly down at his\\nfriend.\\n\\n\"Humble myself? \\'Fore Gad, you must be mad!\"\\n\\n\"Belike I am; but I tell you, Tracy, that if your passion is love, \\'tis\\na strange one that puts yourself first. I would not give the snap of a\\nfinger for it! You want this girl, not for her happiness, but for your\\nown pleasure. That is not the love I once told you would save you from\\nyourself. When it comes, you will count yourself as nought; you will\\nrealise your own insignificance, and above all, be ready to make any\\nsacrifice for her sake. Yes, even to the point of losing her!\"\\n\\nHis Grace\\'s lips sneered.\\n\\n\"Your eloquence is marvellous,\" he remarked. \"I have not been so amused\\nsince I left Paris.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXX\\n\\nHIS GRACE OF ANDOVER TAKES A HAND IN THE GAME\\n\\n\\nWhen the Duke of Andover dined next day at Grosvenor Square, he\\ncontrived, by subtle means, to make his sister feel inexplicably ill at\\nease. He let fall pleasant little remarks concerning her friendship with\\nCaptain Lovelace, in which she read disapproval and a sinister warning.\\nShe was afraid of him, as she was not of her husband, and she knew that\\nif he ever guessed at the depths of her affection for the old flame, he\\nwould take very effective measures towards stopping her intercourse with\\nhim. It was, then, entirely owing to his return that she told Lovelace\\nthat he must not so palpably adore her. Neither must he visit her so\\nfrequently. They were both in her boudoir at the time, one morning, and\\nno doubt Lavinia looked very lovely and very tempting in her wrapper,\\nwith her golden curls free from powder and loosely dressed beneath her\\nescalloped lace ruffle. At all events, Lovelace abandoned his daintily\\nbantering pose and seized her in his arms, nearly smothering her with\\nfierce, passionate caresses.\\n\\nHer ladyship struggled, gave a faint shriek, and started to cry. As his\\nkisses seemed to aggravate her tears, he picked her up, and carrying her\\nto a chair, lowered her gently into it. Then, having first dusted the\\nfloor with his handkerchief, he knelt down beside her and possessed\\nhimself of both her hands.\\n\\n\"Lavinia! Goddess! I adore you!\"\\n\\nBethinking herself that tears were ruinous to her complexion, Lady\\nLavinia pulled her hands away and dabbed at her eyes.\\n\\n\"Oh, Harold!\" she reproached him.\\n\\n\"I have offended you! Wretch that I am--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, no!\" Lady Lavinia gave him her hand again. \"But \\'twas wicked of\\nyou, Harry! You must never, never do it again!\"\\n\\nHis arm crept round her waist.\\n\\n\"But I love you, sweetheart!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Oh! Think of Dicky!\"\\n\\nHe released her at that, and sprang to his feet.\\n\\n\"Why should I think of him? \\'Tis of you and myself I think! Only a week\\nago you vowed he was unkind--\"\\n\\n\"You are monstrous wicked to remind me of that! We were both cross--and\\nthen we were both sorry. I am very fond of poor Dicky.\"\\n\\n\"Fond of him! Ay, so you may be, but you do not love him! Not as a woman\\nloves a man--do you?\"\\n\\n\"Harold!\"\\n\\n\"Of course you do not! You used to love me--no, do not shake your head,\\n\\'tis true! You would have married me had it not been for Tracy.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Harry! How can you say so? What had he to do with it?\"\\n\\n\"What, indeed! Whose fault was it that I was time after time refused\\nadmittance at Andover? Whose fault was it that you were induced to marry\\nCarstares?\"\\n\\n\"Not Tracy\\'s. \\'Twas my own wish.\"\\n\\n\"Fostered by his influence?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no!\"\\n\\n\"You never loved Carstares--\"\\n\\n\"I did! I do!\"\\n\\n\"You may think so, but I know better. Why, he is not even suited to you!\\nYou were made for life and pleasure and hazard! With me you would have\\nhad all that; with him--\"\\n\\nShe had risen to her feet and drawn nearer to him, her eyes sparkling,\\nbut now she covered her ears with her hands and stamped pettishly.\\n\\n\"I will not listen! I will not, I tell you! Oh, you are unkind to plague\\nme so!\"\\n\\nLovelace took her into his arms once more, and drawing down her hands,\\nkissed her again and again. She resisted, trying to thrust him off, but\\nshe was crushed against him, and he would have kissed her again, had not\\nthere come an interruption.\\n\\nA knock fell on the door, and the footman announced:\\n\\n\"His Grace of Andover, m\\'lady!\"\\n\\nThe guilty pair sprang apart in the nick of time, she fiery red, he\\npale, but composed.\\n\\nHis Grace stood in the doorway, his quizzing glass raised inquiringly.\\nHis eyes went swiftly from one to the other and widened. He bowed\\nelaborately.\\n\\n\"My dear Lavinia! Captain Lovelace, your very obedient!\"\\n\\nLovelace returned the bow with much flourish.\\n\\n\"Your Grace!\"\\n\\n\"Dear me, Tracy!\" cried Lavinia, advancing. \"What an unexpected visit!\"\\n\\n\"I trust I have not arrived at an inopportune moment, my dear?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no!\" she assured him. \"I am quite charmed to see you! But at such\\nan early hour--! I confess, it quite astonishes me!\" She brought him to\\na chair, chattering like a child, and so innocent was his expression, so\\nsmiling his attitude towards the Captain, that she imagined that he\\nsuspected nothing, and had not noticed her blushes.\\n\\nIt was only when Lovelace had departed that she was undeceived. Then,\\nwhen his Grace moved to a chair opposite her, she saw that he was\\nfrowning slightly.\\n\\n\"You--you are put out over something, Tracy?\" she asked nervously.\\n\\nThe frown deepened.\\n\\n\"N-no. I am not \\'put out.\\' I merely anticipate the sensation.\"\\n\\n\"I--I don\\'t understand. What mean you?\"\\n\\n\"At present, nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Tracy, please do not be mysterious! Are you like to be put out?\"\\n\\n\"I trust not, Lavinia.\"\\n\\n\"But what annoys you?\"\\n\\nInstead of answering, he put a question:\\n\\n\"I hope you amused yourself well--last night, my dear sister?\"\\n\\nShe flushed. Last night had been Lady Davenant\\'s masquerade, to which\\nLord Robert had conducted her. She had danced almost exclusively with\\nLovelace the whole evening, but as they were both masked, she was rather\\nsurprised at the question.\\n\\n\"I enjoyed myself quite tolerably, thank you. You were there?\"\\n\\n\"No, Lavinia, I was not there.\"\\n\\n\"Then how do you kn--\" She stopped in confusion, biting her lips. For an\\ninstant she caught a glimpse of his eyes, piercing and cold.\\n\\n\"How do I know?\" smoothly finished his Grace \"One hears things, Lavinia.\\nAlso--\" he glanced round the room, \"one sees things.\"\\n\\n\"I--I don\\'t understand you!\" she shot out, twisting the lace of her gown\\nwith restless, uneasy fingers.\\n\\n\"No? Must I then be more explicit?\"\\n\\n\"Yes! Yes! I should be glad!\"\\n\\n\"Then let me beg of you, my dear Lavinia, that you will commit no\\nindiscretion.\"\\n\\nHer cheeks flamed.\\n\\n\"You mean--\"\\n\\n\"I mean that you have grown too friendly with Harold Lovelace.\"\\n\\n\"Well! What of it?\"\\n\\nHis Grace put up his eye-glass, faintly astonished.\\n\\n\"What of it? Pray think a moment, Lavinia!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis not likely that _I_ shall be the one to disgrace the name, Tracy!\"\\n\\n\"I sincerely hope not. I give you my word I should do all in my power to\\nprevent any foolhardy action on your part. Pray do not forget it.\"\\n\\nShe sat silent, biting her lips.\\n\\n\"It is, my child, unwise to play with fire. Sooner or later one gets\\nburnt. And remember that your gallant captain has not one half of\\nRichard\\'s wealth.\"\\n\\nUp she sprang, kicking her skirts as she always did when angered.\\n\\n\"Money! money!--always money!\" she cried. \"I do not care one rap for it!\\nAnd Richard is not wealthy!\"\\n\\n\"Richard is heir to wealth,\" replied his Grace calmly. \"And even an you\\nare so impervious to its charms, I, my dear, am not. Richard is\\nextremely useful to me. I beg you will not leave him for any such mad\\nrake as Lovelace, who would be faithful to you for perhaps three months,\\ncertainly not longer.\"\\n\\n\"Tracy, I will not have you speak to me like this! How dare you insult\\nme so? I have given you no cause! I did not say I had any desire to run\\naway with him--and he _would_ be faithful to me! He has been faithful\\nall these years!\"\\n\\nHis Grace smiled provokingly.\\n\\n\"My dear--!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I know there have been episodes--indiscretions. Do you think I\\ncount him the worse for that?\"\\n\\n\"Evidently not.\"\\n\\n\"There has never been another serious love with him! I hate you!\"\\n\\n\"You are overfree with your emotions, my dear. So you do indeed\\ncontemplate an elopement?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, no! I do not! I am _fond_ of Dicky!\"\\n\\n\"Dear me!\"\\n\\n\"Of course I shall not leave him!\"\\n\\n\"Why then, I am satisfied,\" he answered, and rose to his feet. \"I shall\\nlook to see Captain Lovelace more out of your company.\" He picked up his\\nhat and cane and stood directly in front of her. One dead white hand, on\\nwhich blazed a great ruby seal ring, took her little pointed chin in a\\nfirm clasp and tilted her head up until she was forced to meet his eyes.\\nThey held hers inexorably, scorchingly.\\n\\n\"You understand me?\" he asked harshly.\\n\\nLavinia\\'s eyes filled with tears and her soft underlip trembled.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she fluttered, and gave a tiny sob. \"Oh, yes, Tracy!\"\\n\\nThe eyes lost something of their menacing gleam, and he smiled, for once\\nwithout a sneer, and releasing her chin, patted her cheek indulgently.\\n\\n\"Bear in mind, child, that I am fifteen years your senior, and I have\\nmore worldly wisdom in my little finger than you have in the whole of\\nyour composition. I do not wish to witness your ruin.\"\\n\\nThe tears brimmed over, and she caught his handkerchief from him,\\ndabbing at her eyes with one heavily-laced corner.\\n\\n\"You do love me, Tracy?\"\\n\\n\"In the recesses of my mind I believe I cherish some affection for you,\"\\nhe replied coolly, rescuing his handkerchief. \"I used to class you with\\nyour deplorable brothers, but I think perhaps I was wrong.\"\\n\\nShe gave an hysterical laugh.\\n\\n\"Tracy, how can you be so disagreeable? Lud! but I pity Diana an she\\nmarries you!\"\\n\\nTo her surprise he flushed a little.\\n\\n\"Diana, an she marries me, will have all that her heart could desire,\"\\nhe answered stiffly, and took his leave.\\n\\nOnce outside in the square he looked for a sedan, and not seeing one,\\nwalked away towards Audley Street. He went quickly, but his progress was\\nsomewhat retarded by two ladies, who, passing in their chairs down the\\nstreet, perceived him and beckoned him to their sides. Escaping\\npresently from them, he turned into Curzon Street, and from thence down\\nHalf Moon Street, where he literally fell into the arms of Tom Wilding,\\nwho had much to say on the subject of March\\'s last bet with Edgecumbe.\\nHis Grace affected interest, politely declined Wilding\\'s proffered\\nescort, and hurried down into Piccadilly, walking eastwards towards St.\\nJames\\'s Square, where was the Andover town house. He was fated to be\\nagain detained, for as he walked along Arlington Street, Mr. Walpole was\\non the point of descending the steps of No. 5. He also had much to say\\nto his Grace. He had no idea that Belmanoir had returned from Paris. A\\nweek ago he had arrived? Well, he, Walpole, had been out of town all the\\nweek--at Twickenham. He hoped Bel. would honour him with his company at\\nthe small card-party he was giving there on Thursday. George was coming,\\nand Dick Edgecumbe; he had asked March and Gilly Williams, but the Lord\\nknew whether both would be induced to appear! Bel. had heard of Gilly\\'s\\nabsurd jealousy? Wilding was promised, and Markham; several other\\nanswers he was awaiting.\\n\\nAndover accepted gracefully and parted from Mr. Walpole. He made the\\nrest of his journey in peace, and on arriving at his house, went\\nstraight to the library, where sat a sleek, eminently\\nrespectable-looking individual, dressed like a groom. He stood up as his\\nGrace entered, and bowed.\\n\\nBelmanoir nodded shortly and sat down at his desk.\\n\\n\"I have work for you, Harper.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir--your Grace, I should say.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know Sussex?\"\\n\\n\"Well, your Grace, I don\\'t know as how--\"\\n\\n\"_Do you know Sussex?_\"\\n\\n\"No, your Grace--er--yes, your Grace! I should say, not well, your\\nGrace!\"\\n\\n\"Have you heard of a place called Littledean?\"\\n\\n\"No, s--your Grace.\"\\n\\n\"Midhurst?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, your Grace.\"\\n\\n\"Good. Littledean is seven miles west of it. You will find that\\nout--also an inn called, I think, \\'The Pointing Finger.\\' There you will\\nlodge.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, your Grace, certainly.\"\\n\\n\"At a very little distance from there is a house--Horton House, where\\nlives a certain Mr. Beauleigh, with his sister and daughter. You are to\\nwatch the comings and goings of these people with the utmost care.\\nEventually you will become groom to Mr. Beauleigh.\"\\n\\n\"B-but, your Grace!\" feebly protested the astonished Harper.\\n\\n\"You will approach their present groom, and you will insinuate that I,\\nAndover, am in need of a second groom. You will tell him that I pay\\nhandsomely--treble what Mr. Beauleigh gives him. If I know human nature,\\nhe will apply for the post. You then step in. If Mr. Beauleigh asks for\\nsome recommendation, you are to refer him to Sir Hugh Grandison, White\\'s\\nChocolate House, St. James\\'s Street. When you are engaged I will send\\nfurther instructions.\"\\n\\nThe man gaped, shut his mouth, and gaped again.\\n\\n\"Do you fully understand me?\" asked Belmanoir calmly.\\n\\n\"Er--er--yes, your Grace!\"\\n\\n\"Repeat what I have said, then.\"\\n\\nHarper stumbled through it and mopped his brow unhappily.\\n\\n\"Very well. In addition, I pay you twice as much as Mr. Beauleigh gives\\nyou, and, at the end, if you serve me well--fifty guineas. Are you\\nsatisfied?\"\\n\\nHarper brightened considerably.\\n\\n\"Yes, your Grace! Thank you, sir!\"\\n\\nTracy laid twenty guineas before him.\\n\\n\"That is for your expenses. Remember this: the sooner the thing is done,\\nthe more certain are your fifty guineas. That is all. Have you any\\nquestions to ask?\"\\n\\nHarper cudgelled his still dazed brain, and finding none, shook his\\nhead.\\n\\n\"No, your Grace.\"\\n\\n\"Then you may go.\"\\n\\nThe man bowed himself out, clutching his guineas. He was comparatively a\\nnewcomer in his Grace\\'s service, and he was by no means accustomed to\\nthe Duke\\'s lightning method of conducting his affairs. He was not sure\\nthat he quite appreciated it. But fifty guineas were fifty guineas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXI\\n\\nMRS. FANSHAWE LIGHTS A FIRE AND O\\'HARA FANS THE FLAME\\n\\n\\nRichard Carstares very soon availed himself of Mrs. Fanshawe\\'s\\npermission to call upon her, and duly put in an appearance at No. 16,\\nMount Street. He found the house very tastefully appointed, the sister\\nelderly and good-natured, and the widow herself an excellent hostess.\\nThe first time he called he was not the only visitor; two ladies whom he\\ndid not know and a young cousin were already there, and later, a bowing\\nacquaintance, Mr. Standish, also arrived. Seeing that he would have no\\nopportunity to talk with the widow on the subject of his brother, he\\nvery soon took his leave, promising to wait upon her again at no very\\ndistant date. When, three days later, he again sent in his name and was\\nadmitted, he found the lady alone, and was gratified to hear her order\\nthe servant to deny her to all other visitors.\\n\\nHe bowed over her hand and hoped she was well.\\n\\nMrs. Fanshawe drew him down beside her on the settee.\\n\\n\"I am very well, Mr. Carstares. And you?\"\\n\\n\"Also,\" he smiled, but his looks belied his words.\\n\\nShe told him so, laughing, and he pleaded a worried week.\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I presume you did not come to talk to me about your health,\\nbut about my friend--eh?\"\\n\\n\"I assure--\"\\n\\n\"Remember, no vapid compliments!\" she besought.\\n\\n\"Then, madam, yes. I want to hear about--Ferndale. You see, I--like\\nyou--took a great interest in him.\"\\n\\nShe sent him a shrewd glance, and nodded.\\n\\n\"Of course. I will tell you all I know, Mr. Carstares, but it is not\\nvery much, and maybe you will be disappointed. But I only knew him the\\nshort time we were both in Vienna, and--he was not very communicative.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!--he did not confide in you, madam?\"\\n\\n\"No. If one attempted to draw his confidence, he became a polite\\niceberg.\"\\n\\n\"Nevertheless, madam, please tell me all that you know.\"\\n\\n\"It will not take long, I fear. I met him in \\'48 at Vienna, in the\\nPrater, where I was walking with my husband, who had come to Vienna for\\nhis health. I chanced to let fall my reticule when Sir Anthony was\\npassing us, and he picked it up, speaking the most execrable German.\"\\nShe smiled a little at the remembrance. \"Mr. Fanshawe, who had the\\ngreatest dislike for all foreigners, was overjoyed to hear the English\\naccent. He induced Sir Anthony to continue his walk with us, and\\nafterwards he called at our lodgings. I think he, too, was glad to meet\\na fellow-countryman, for he came often, and once when I had been talking\\nwith him for some time he let fall--what shall I say?--his reserve--his\\nguard--and told me that he had scarcely spoken his own language for four\\nyears. Afterwards he seemed to regret having said even that much, and\\nturned the subject.\" She paused and looked up to see if her auditor was\\ninterested.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes?\" urged Richard. \"And then?\"\\n\\n\"I do not remember. He came, as I said, often, mostly to talk to my\\nhusband, who was a great invalid, but sometimes to see me. He would\\nhardly ever speak of England--I think he did not trust himself. He never\\nmentioned any relations or any English friends, and when I spoke of\\nhome, he would shut his mouth very tightly, and look terribly sad. I\\nsaw that for some reason the subject pained him, so I never spoke of it\\nif I could help it.\\n\\n\"He was a most entertaining companion, Mr. Carstares; he used to tell my\\nhusband tales that made him laugh as I had not heard him laugh for\\nmonths. He was very lively, very witty, and almost finickingly well\\ndressed, but what his occupation was I could not quite ascertain. He\\nsaid he was a gentleman of leisure, but I do not think he was at all\\nwealthy. He frequented all the gaming houses, and I heard tales of his\\nmarvellous luck, so one day I taxed him with it, and he laughed and said\\nhe lived by Chance--he meant dice. Yet I know, for I once had\\nconversation with his servant, that his purse was at times very, very\\nslender.\"\\n\\n\"The time he aided you, Mrs. Fanshawe, when was that?\"\\n\\nShe flushed.\\n\\n\"That was a few months after we first met him. I was--foolish; my\\nmarried life was not--very happy, and I was--or, rather, I fancied\\nmyself--in love with an Austrian nobleman, who--who--well, sir, suffice\\nit that I consented to dine with him one evening. I found then that he\\nwas not the _galant homme_ I had thought him, but something quite\\ndifferent. I do not know what I should have done had not Sir Anthony\\narrived.\"\\n\\n\"He did arrive then?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. You see, he knew that this Austrian had asked me to dine--I told\\nhim--and he counselled me to refuse. But I--well, sir, I have told you,\\nI was young and very foolish--I would not listen. When he called at our\\nhouse and found that I was out, he at once guessed where I had gone, and\\nhe followed me to the Count\\'s house, gave an Austrian name, and was\\nannounced just as the Count tried to--tried to--kiss me. I think I shall\\nnever forget the relief of that moment! He was so safe, and so English!\\nThe Count was furious, and at first I thought he would have his lackeys\\nthrow Anthony out. But when he heard all that Anthony had to say, he\\nrealised that it was useless to try to detain me--and I was taken home.\\nAnthony was very kind--he did not scold, neither had he told my husband.\\nTwo days after, he and the Count fought a duel, and the Count was\\nwounded in the lung. That was all. But it made me very grateful to him\\nand interested in his affairs. Mr. Fanshawe left Vienna a few weeks\\nafter that, and I have never seen my _preux chevalier_ since.\" She\\nsighed and looked steadily across at Carstares. \"And you--you are so\\nlike him!\"\\n\\n\"You think so, madam?\" was all he could find to say.\\n\\n\"I do, sir. And something more, which, perhaps, you will deem an\\nimpertinence. Is Anthony your brother?\"\\n\\nThe suddenness of the attack threw Carstares off his guard. He went\\nwhite.\\n\\n\"Madam!\"\\n\\n\"Please be not afraid that mine is the proverbial woman\\'s tongue, sir.\\nIt does not run away with me, I assure you. When I saw you the other\\nnight for the first time, I was struck by the resemblance, and I asked\\nmy partner, Mr. Stapely, who you were. He told me, and much more beside,\\nwhich I was not at the time desirous of hearing.\"\\n\\n\"Trust Will Stapely!\" exclaimed Richard, and mentally cursed the amiable\\ngossip-monger.\\n\\n\"Among other things he told me of your elder brother-who--who--in fact,\\nhe told me the whole story. Of course, my mind instantly leapt to my\\npoor Sir Anthony, despite that in appearance he is younger than you. Was\\nI right?\"\\n\\nRichard rose to his feet and walked away to the window, standing with\\nhis back to her.\\n\\n\"Ay!\"\\n\\n\"I was sure of it,\" she nodded. \"So that was why he would not speak of\\nEngland? Poor boy!\"\\n\\nRichard\\'s soul writhed under the lash of her pity.\\n\\n\"So he will always be outcast,\" she continued. \"Alone, unhappy, without\\nfriends--\"\\n\\n\"No!\" he cried, turning. \"\\'Fore Gad, no, madam!\"\\n\\n\"Will society--cruel, hard society--receive him, then?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Society will--one day--receive him, Mrs. Fanshawe. You will see.\"\\n\\n\"I long for that day,\" she sighed. \"I wish I had it in my power to help\\nhim--to repay in part the debt I owe him.\"\\n\\nAt that he lifted his head.\\n\\n\"My brother, madam, would count it not a debt, but an honour,\" he\\nanswered proudly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she smiled. \"You are like him; when you speak like that you might\\nalmost be he.\"\\n\\n\"He is worth a thousand of me, Mrs. Fanshawe!\" he replied vehemently,\\nand broke off, staring down at the table.\\n\\n\"And his name?\" she asked softly.\\n\\n\"John Anthony St. Ervine Delaney Carstares,\" he said, \"Earl of Wyncham.\"\\n\\n\"So the Anthony was real! I am so glad, for he would always be Anthony\\nto me.\"\\n\\nThere was a long silence, broken at last by the lady.\\n\\n\"I fear I have made you sad, Mr. Carstares. You will drink a dish of\\nBohea with me, before you go? And we will not speak of this again.\"\\n\\n\"You are very good, madam. Believe me, I am grateful to you for telling\\nme all that you have. I beg you will allow me to wait on you again ere\\nlong?\"\\n\\n\"I shall be honoured, sir. I am nearly always at home to my friends.\"\\n\\nHer sister entered the room soon after, and private conversation came to\\nan end.\\n\\nCarstares lay awake long that night, hearing the hours toll by and the\\nowls screech in the square. The widow\\'s words had sunk deep into his\\never-uneasy conscience, and he could not sleep for the thought of John,\\n\"alone, unhappy, without friends.\" ... Time after time had he argued\\nthis question with himself: John or Lavinia? ... He fell to wondering\\nwhere his brother now was; whether he was still roaming the South\\nCountry, a highwayman. No one would ever know how he, Richard, dreaded\\neach fresh capture made by the military. Every time he expected John to\\nbe among the prisoners, and he visited Newgate so often that his friends\\ntwitted him on it, vowing he had Selwyn\\'s love of horrors.\\n\\nHe would argue that the matter rested in John\\'s own hands: if he were\\nminded to come back to society, he would do so; but deep within himself\\nhe knew that such a decision was unworthy of one even so debased as was\\nhe. Then his mind went to Lavinia, who alternately enchanted and\\nexasperated him. Only a week ago she had defied him openly in the matter\\nof her friendship with Lovelace, yet had she not afterwards apologised,\\nand thrust the Captain aside for his sake? She was so sweetly naughty,\\nso childishly unreasonable. Selfish? Yes, he supposed so, but he loved\\nher!--loved her so greatly that it were a pleasure to him to die for her\\nsake. Yet John--John was his brother--the adored elder brother, and by\\nobeying Lavinia he was wronging him, hurting him. If only Lavinia would\\nconsent to the truth being told! It always came back to that point: if\\nonly she would consent. And she never would. She insisted that, having\\nmarried her under false pretences, he had no right to disgrace her now.\\nShe was right, he knew, but he wished she could be for once unselfish.\\n\\nSo he worried on through the night, tossing to and fro in his great bed,\\na weight on his mind, a ceaseless ache in his heart.\\n\\nTowards dawn he fell asleep and did not wake again until his chocolate\\nwas brought to him. Bitterly he reflected that at least John had no\\nconscience to prey upon him; he did not fall asleep with his brain\\nseething with conflicting arguments, and awake with the decision as far\\noff as ever. To-day his head ached unbearably, and he stayed in bed for\\nsome time contemplating the grey morning. A fog hung over the Square,\\nand through it the trees, with their withered autumn leaves, loomed\\ndismally before the windows. There was something infinitely depressing\\nabout the dull outlook, and presently he rose and allowed his valet to\\ndress him, not able to stand the inaction any longer. His headache was\\nbetter by the time he had visited his wife in her room, and listened to\\nher enthusiastic account of last night\\'s rout, and, going out into the\\nsquare, he called a chair, ordering the men to carry him to White\\'s,\\nwhere he intended to write two letters. Somehow, Wyncham House was too\\npoignantly full of memories of John to-day, and he was thankful to be\\nout of it.\\n\\nWhite\\'s was crowded even at that hour of the morning, and the noise\\nseemed to cut through his head. Men hailed him from all sides, offering\\nhim bets; someone tried to tell him some piece of scandal; they would\\nnot let him alone, and at last his jagged nerves would no longer support\\nit, and he left the house to go further down the street to his other\\nclub, the Cocoa-Tree, which he hoped to find less rowdy. It was fuller\\nthan he expected, but many of the men had come as he had, to write\\nletters and to be quiet. Very little gaming was as yet in swing.\\n\\nRichard wrote steadily for perhaps an hour, and sealed his last letter\\npreparatory to leaving. As he affixed the wafer, he was conscious of a\\nstir behind him, and heard exclamations of:\\n\\n\"Where in thunder did you spring from?\"\\n\\n\"Gad, \\'tis an age since I\\'ve seen you!\"\\n\\n\"Lord, \\'tis O\\'Hara!\"\\n\\nThen came the soft Irish voice in answer, and he slewed round in his\\nchair to face them all. Miles O\\'Hara was the centre of a little group of\\ninterested and welcoming clubmen, explaining his arrival.\\n\\n\"Sure, I was in town on a matter of business, and I thought I must come\\nto the club to see ye all while I was here, for \\'tis not often I get the\\nchance--\"\\n\\nRichard rose, gathering up his letters and stared across at this man who\\nhad been Jack\\'s greatest friend. He took a step towards him. As he did\\nso, O\\'Hara turned and caught sight of him. Richard was about to hail\\nhim, when he suddenly noticed the change in his expression. The good\\nhumour died out of the Irishman\\'s eyes and left them hard and scornful.\\nHis pleasant mouth curved into a disdainful line. Carstares stood still,\\none hand on the back of a chair, his eyes rivetted to O\\'Hara\\'s face,\\nreading all the reproach, the red-hot anger that Miles was trying to\\nconvey to him. O\\'Hara achieved a sneer and turned his shoulder,\\ncontinuing to address his friends.\\n\\nRichard\\'s head swam. O\\'Hara was ignoring him, would not speak to him....\\nO\\'Hara knew the truth! He walked blindly to the door, and groped for the\\nhandle.... O\\'Hara knew! He was in the passage, on the front steps, in\\nthe road, shuddering. O\\'Hara knew, and he had looked at him as if--as\\nif--again he shuddered, and seeing an empty chair, hailed it, bidding\\nthe men carry him to Grosvenor Square.... O\\'Hara despised\\nhim!--reproached him! Then Jack was in trouble? He had seen him and\\nlearnt the truth? God, but his brain was reeling! ...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXII\\n\\nDEVELOPMENTS\\n\\n\\nAfter the encounter with O\\'Hara, whatever peace of mind Richard had had,\\nleft him. He knew not a moment\\'s quiet; all day, and sometimes all\\nnight, his brain worried round and round the everlasting question: John\\nor Lavinia? He had quite decided that it must be either the one or the\\nother; the idea that he might conceivably retain his wife _and_ confess\\nthe truth, never occurred to him. So often had Lavinia assured him that\\nhe had no right to expect her to share his disgrace, that now he\\nbelieved it. He thought that she would elope with Lovelace, whom, his\\ntortured mind decided, she really loved. Any attempt to frustrate such\\nan action would, he supposed wretchedly, be the essence of selfishness.\\nOf course he was not himself, and his brain was not working normally or\\nrationally; had he but known it, he was mentally ill, and if Lavinia had\\nthought to examine him closely she could not have failed to observe the\\nfever spots on each cheek, the unnaturally bright eyes and the dark\\nrings encircling them. Richard wore the look of one goaded beyond\\nendurance, and utterly tired and overwrought. As he told Mrs. Fanshawe,\\nwhen she exclaimed at his appearance--he could not rest; he must always\\nbe moving, thinking. She saw that he was not entirely himself, and\\ncounselled him to consult a doctor. His half-angry repudiation of all\\nillness did not surprise her, but she was considerably startled when, in\\nanswer to her pleading that he should have a care for himself, he\\nvehemently said: \"If I could die, I should be glad!\" She wondered what\\nhis wife was about not to see his condition, and wished that she might\\ndo something. But she was not acquainted with Lady Lavinia, and she\\nfelt it would be a piece of gross presumption on her part to speak to\\nher of Richard. If she had thought his malady to be physical, she\\nreflected, she might venture a word, but as she perceived it to be\\nmental, she could only hope that it would pass in time, and that he\\nwould recover from his run-down condition.\\n\\nLady Lavinia was pursuing her butterfly existence, heeding nothing but\\nher own pleasure, bent on enjoying herself. She succeeded very well, on\\nthe whole, but she could not help wishing that Dicky were a little more\\ncheerful and wishful to join in her gaiety. Of late he was worse than\\never, and although he supplied her wants uncomplainingly, she would\\nalmost rather he had refused her and shown a little life, than give way\\nto her with this dreadful apathy.\\n\\nLovelace was out of town for a week, and Lavinia was surprised to find\\nhow little she missed him. To be sure, playing with fire was very\\npleasant, but when it was removed out of her reach, it really made no\\nodds. She missed Harry\\'s adulation and his passionate love-making, for\\nshe was one of those women who must always have admiration and\\nexcitement, but she was not made miserable by his absence. She continued\\nto flutter round to all the entertainments of the season with one or\\nother of her brothers, and when Lovelace returned he was disturbed by\\nher casual welcome. However, she was undoubtedly pleased to see him, and\\nsoon fell more or less under his spell, allowing him to be by her side\\nwhen Tracy was not near, and to charm her ears with compliments and\\ngallantry.\\n\\nTo do him justice, Captain Harold was really in love with her and was\\nquite ready to relinquish his commission if only she would run away with\\nhim. He had private means of his own, and promised her that her every\\nwhim should be satisfied. But Lavinia scolded him and shook her head.\\nApart from any ulterior consideration, Richard was, after all, her\\nhusband; he, too, loved her, and she was very, very fond of him,\\nalthough she did plague him dreadfully.\\n\\nLovelace assured her that her husband did not love her nearly as much as\\nhe, and when she smiled her disbelief, lost his temper and cried that\\nall the town knew Carstares to be at Mrs. Fanshawe\\'s feet!\\n\\nLavinia stiffened.\\n\\n\"Harold!\"\\n\\n\"I am only surprised that you have been blind to it,\" he continued.\\n\"Where do you think he goes every day for so long? White\\'s? No. To 16,\\nMount Street! Stapely called there and met him; another day Lady\\nDavenant saw him with her; Wilding has also met him at her house. He\\nspends nearly every afternoon with her!\"\\n\\nLavinia was a Belmanoir, and she had all the Belmanoir pride. Rising to\\nher feet she drew her cloak about her with her most queenly air.\\n\\n\"You forget yourself, Harold,\" she said haughtily. \"Never dare to speak\\nto me of my husband again in that tone! You may take me at once to my\\nbrother.\"\\n\\nHe was very penitent, wording his apology most cleverly, smoothing her\\nruffled plumage, withdrawing his words, but at the same time contriving\\nto leave their sting behind. She forgave him, yes, but he must never\\noffend her so again.\\n\\nAlthough she had indignantly refused to believe the scandal, it\\nnevertheless rankled, and she found herself watching her husband with\\njealous eyes, noticing his seeming indifference towards her and his\\nmany absences from home. Then came a day when she caused her chair to be\\nborne down Mount Street at the very moment when Richard was coming out\\nof No. 16.\\n\\nThat was enough for Lavinia. So he was indeed tired of her! He loved\\nanother woman!--some wretched widow! For the first time a real worry\\nplagued her. She stayed at home that evening and exerted all her arts to\\ncaptivate her husband. But Richard, seeing John unhappy, reproachful,\\nevery way he turned, his head on fire, his brain seething with\\nconflicting arguments, hardly noticed her, and as soon as he might\\npolitely do so, left her, to pace up and down the library floor, trying\\nto make up his mind what to do.\\n\\nLady Lavinia was stricken with horror. She had sickened him by her\\nmegrims, as Tracy had prophesied she would! He no longer cared for her!\\n_This_ was why he continually excused himself from accompanying her when\\nshe went out! For once in her life she faced facts, and the prospect\\nalarmed her. If it was not already too late, she must try to win back\\nhis love, and to do this she realised she must cease to tease him for\\nmoney, and also cease to snap at him whenever she felt at all out of\\nsorts. She must charm him back to her. She had no idea how much she\\ncared for him until now that she thought he did not care for her. It was\\ndreadful: she had always been so sure of Dicky! Whatever she did,\\nhowever exasperating she might be, he would always adore her.\\n\\nAnd all the time, Richard, far from making love to Mrs. Fanshawe, was\\nhearing anecdotes of his brother from her, little details of his\\nappearance, things he had said. He drank in all the information,\\nclutching eagerly at each fresh scrap of gossip, greedy to hear it if it\\nin any way concerned John. His brain was absorbed with this one\\nsubject, and he never saw when Lavinia smiled upon him, nor did he seem\\nto hear her coaxing speeches. When she remarked, as she presently did,\\non his pallor, he almost snapped at her, and left the room. Once she put\\nher arms about him and kissed him on the lips; he put her gently aside,\\ntoo worried to respond to the caress, but, had she known it--grateful\\nfor it.\\n\\nHis Grace of Andover meeting his sister at Ranelagh Gardens, thought her\\nface looked pinched, and her eyes unhappy. He inquired the reason, but\\nLady Lavinia refused to confide even in him, and pleaded a headache.\\nAndover, knowing her, imagined that she had been refused some kickshaw,\\nand thought no more about it.\\n\\nHe himself was very busy. Only two days before a groom had presented\\nhimself at St. James\\'s Square, bearing a missive from Harper, very\\nillegible and ill-spelt, but to the point:\\n\\n\"YR. GRACE,\\n\\n\"I have took the liberty of engageing this Man, Douglas, in Yr. Name. I\\nhope I shall soon be Able to have carrid out the Rest of yr. Grace\\'s\\nInstructions, and trust my Connduct will met with Yr. Grace\\'s Approvall.\\n\\nVery Obed\\'tly,\\n\\nM. HARPER.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nTracy confirmed the engagement and straightway dispatched the man to\\nAndover, where the head groom would undoubtedly find work for him to do.\\nHe was amused at the blind way in which the man had walked into his\\ntrap, and meditated cynically on the frailty of human nature, which\\nwill always follow the great god Mammon.\\n\\nNot three days later came another letter, this time from Mr. Beauleigh,\\naddressed to him at White\\'s, under the name of Sir Hugh Grandison. It\\nasked for the man Harper\\'s character.\\n\\nHis Grace of Andover answered it in the library of his own home, and\\nsmiled sarcastically as he wrote Harper down \"exceeding honest and\\ntrustworthy, as I have always found.\"\\n\\nHe was in the middle of the letter when the door was unceremoniously\\npushed open and Andrew lounged into the room.\\n\\nHis Grace looked up frowning. Not a whit dismayed by the coolness of his\\nreception, his brother kicked the door to and lowered his long limbs\\ninto a chair.\\n\\n\"May I ask to what I owe the honour of this intrusion?\" smiled Tracy\\ndangerously.\\n\\n\"Richard,\" was the cheerful reply, \"Richard.\"\\n\\n\"As I am not interested in either him or his affairs--\"\\n\\n\"How truly amiable you are to-day! But I think you\\'ll be interested in\\nthis, \\'tis so vastly mysterious.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed? What is the matter?\"\\n\\n\"Just what I want to know!\"\\n\\nTracy sighed wearily.\\n\\n\"Pray come to the point, Andrew--if point there be. I have no time to\\nwaste.\"\\n\\n\"Lord! Busy? Working? God ha\\' mercy!\" The young rake stretched his legs\\nout before him and cast his eyes down their shapeliness. Then he\\nstiffened and sat up, staring at one white-stockinged ankle.\\n\\n\"Now, damn and curse it! where did that come from?\" he expostulated\\nmildly.\\n\\n\"Where did _what_ come from?\"\\n\\n\"That great splash of mud on my leg. Brand new on this morning, and I\\'ve\\nscarce set my nose without doors. Damn it, I say! A brand new--\"\\n\\n\"Leg?\"\\n\\n\"Hey? What\\'s that you say?\"\\n\\n\"Nought. When you have quite finished your eulogy, perhaps you would\\nconsent to tell me your errand?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, ay!--but twenty shillings the pair! Think of it! ... Well, the\\npoint--there is one, you see--is this: it is Richard\\'s desire that you\\nhonour him with your presence at Wyncham on Friday week, at three in the\\nafternoon exactly. To which effect he sends you this.\" He tossed a\\nletter on to the desk. \"You are like to have the felicity of meeting me\\nthere.\"\\n\\nTracy ripped open the packet and spread the single sheet on the desk\\nbefore him. He read it through very deliberately, turned it over, as if\\nin search of more, re-read it, folded it, and dropped it into the\\nwastebasket at his side. He then picked up his quill and dipped it in\\nthe ink again.\\n\\n\"What think you?\" demanded Andrew, impatiently.\\n\\nHis Grace wrote tranquilly on to the end of the line.\\n\\n\"What think I of what?\"\\n\\n\"Why, the letter, of course! What ails the man? \\'Something of great\\nimport to impart to us,\\' forsooth! What means he?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I noticed \\'twas very badly worded,\" commented Tracy. \"I have not\\nthe vaguest notion as to his meaning.\"\\n\\n\"But what do you make of it? Lord, Tracy, don\\'t be such a fish! Dick is\\nsummoning quite a party!\"\\n\\n\"You appear to be in his confidence, my dear Andrew. Allow me to\\ncongratulate you. No doubt we shall know more--ah--on Friday week, at\\nthree o\\'clock.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'ll go, then?\"\\n\\n\"Quite possibly.\" He went on writing unconcernedly.\\n\\n\"And you\\'ve no idea of what \\'tis about? Dick is very strange. He hardly\\nlistens to what one has to say, and fidget--Lord!\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\"\\n\\n\"I think he looks ill, an\\' \\'pon my soul, so does Lavvy! Do you suppose\\nthere is aught amiss?\"\\n\\n\"I really have no idea. Pray do not let me detain you.\"\\n\\nAndrew hoisted himself out of his chair.\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m not staying, never fear! ... I suppose you cannot oblige me\\nwith--say--fifty guineas?\"\\n\\n\"I should be loth to upset your suppositions,\" replied his Grace\\nsweetly.\\n\\n\"You will not? Well, I didn\\'t think you would somehow! But I wish you\\nmight contrive to let me have it, Tracy. I\\'ve had prodigious ill-luck of\\nlate, and the Lord knows \\'tis not much I get from you! I don\\'t want to\\nask Dick again.\"\\n\\n\"I should not let the performance grow monotonous, certainly,\" agreed\\nthe other. \"Fifty, you said?\"\\n\\n\"Forty-five would suffice.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you may have it!\" shrugged his Grace. \"At once?\"\\n\\n\"Blister me, but that\\'s devilish good of you, Tracy! At once would be\\nconvenient to _me_!\"\\n\\nHis Grace produced a key from his vest pocket and unlocked a drawer in\\nthe desk. From it he took a small box. He counted out fifty guineas, and\\nadded another to the pile. Andrew stared at it.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that for?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"The stockings,\" replied Tracy, with a ghost of a smile. Andrew burst\\nout laughing.\\n\\n\"That\\'s good! Gad! but you\\'re devilish amusing, \\'pon rep. you are!\" He\\nthanked his Grace profusely and gathering up the money, left the room.\\n\\nOutside he gave vent to a low whistle of astonishment. \"Tare an\\' ouns!\\nhe must be monstrous well-pleased over something!\" he marvelled. \"I\\nshall awaken soon, I doubt not.\" He chuckled a little as he descended\\nthe staircase, but his face was full of wonderment.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nLovelace called nearly every day at Wyncham House, but was always\\nrefused admittance, as Lady Lavinia deemed it prudent not to see him.\\nThere came a day, however, when he would not be gainsaid, and was\\nushered into her drawing-room. He kissed her hands lingeringly, holding\\nthem for a long while in his.\\n\\n\"Lavinia! Cruel fair one!\"\\n\\nShe drew her hands away, not too well pleased at his intrusion.\\n\\n\"How silly, Harold! I cannot have you tease me every day!\"\\n\\nShe allowed him to sit by her on the window seat, and he again possessed\\nhimself of her hands. Did she love him? She hoped he was not going to be\\nfoolish. Of course not. He did not believe her, and started to plead his\\nsuit, imploring her to come away with him. In vain Lady Lavinia begged\\nhim to be quiet; she had stirred up a blaze, and it threatened to\\nconsume her. He was so insistent that, expecting Richard at any moment,\\nand terrified lest there should be a disturbance, she promised to give\\nhim an answer next evening, at the theatre. She managed to be rid of him\\nin this way, and, with a relieved sigh, watched him walk down the\\nsquare. She was very fond of dear Harry, but really, he was dreadfully\\ntiresome at times.\\n\\nShe brought her tiny mirror out from her pocket and surveyed her\\nreflection critically, giving a tweak to one curl, and smoothing another\\nback. She was afraid she was looking rather old this evening, and hoped\\nthat Richard would not think so. She glanced up at the clock, wondering\\nwhere he was; surely he should be in by now? Then she arranged a chair\\ninvitingly, pushed a stool up to it and sat down opposite. With a sigh,\\nshe reflected that it was an entirely new departure for her to strive to\\nplease and captivate her husband, and she fell a-thinking of how he must\\nhave waited on her in the old days, waiting as she was waiting\\nnow--hoping for her arrival. Lady Lavinia was beginning to realise that\\nperhaps Dick\\'s life had not been all roses with her as wife.\\n\\nThe door opened and Richard came into the room. Deep lines were between\\nhis brows, but his mouth was for once set firmly. He looked sombrely\\ndown at her, thinking how very beautiful she was.\\n\\nLady Lavinia smiled and nodded towards the chair she had prepared.\\n\\n\"Sit down, Dicky! I am so glad you have come! I was monstrous dull and\\nlonely, I assure you!\"\\n\\n\"Were you?\" he said, fidgeting with her scissors. \"No, I will not sit\\ndown. I have something to say to you, Lavinia. Something to tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, _have_ you?\" she asked. \"Something nice, Dicky?\"\\n\\n\"I fear you will hardly think so. I am about to make an end.\"\\n\\n\"Oh--oh, are you? Of _what_?\"\\n\\n\"Of this--this deceitful life I am leading--have been leading. I--I--I\\nam going to confess the whole truth.\"\\n\\n\"Rich-ard!\"\\n\\nHe let fall the scissors and paced restlessly away down the room.\\n\\n\"I--I tell you, Lavinia, I cannot endure it! I cannot! I cannot! The\\nthought of what John may be bearing is driving me crazy! I must speak!\"\\n\\n\"You--you can\\'t!\" she gasped. \"After seven years! Dicky, for heaven\\'s\\nsake--!\" The colour ebbed and flowed in her cheeks.\\n\\n\"I cannot continue any longer this living of a lie--I have been feeling\\nit more and more ever since--ever since I met--Jack--that time on the\\nroad. And now I can no longer stand it. Everywhere I go I seem to see\\nhim--looking at me--you don\\'t understand--\"\\n\\nLavinia cast aside her work.\\n\\n\"No! No! I do not! \\'Pon rep., but you should have thought of this\\nbefore, Dick!\"\\n\\n\"I know it. Nothing can excuse my cowardice--my weakness. I know all\\nthat, but it is not too late even now to make amends. In a week they\\nwill all know the truth.\"\\n\\n\"What--what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I have requested all whom it concerns to come to Wyncham the Friday\\nafter this.\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens! Dick, Dick, _think_!\"\\n\\n\"I have thought. God! _how_ I have thought!\"\\n\\n\"It is not fair to me! Oh, think of your honour--Wyncham!\"\\n\\n\"My honour is less than nothing. \\'Tis of his that I think.\"\\n\\nShe sprang up, clutching at his arm, shaking him.\\n\\n\"Richard, you are mad! You must not do this! You must not, I say!\"\\n\\n\"I implore you, Lavinia, not to try to make me change my decision. It is\\nof no use. Nothing you can say will make any difference.\"\\n\\nShe flew into a passion, flinging away from him, her good resolutions\\nforgotten.\\n\\n\"You have no right to disgrace me! If you do it, I will never forgive\\nyou! I won\\'t stay with you--I--\"\\n\\nHe broke in--this was what he had expected; he must not whine; this was\\nretribution.\\n\\n\"I know. I have faced that.\"\\n\\nShe was breathless for a moment. He knew! He had faced it! He had taken\\nher seriously--he always expected her to leave him! Oh, he must indeed\\nbe tired of her, and wanted her to go! What was he saying?\\n\\n\"I know that you love Lovelace. I--I have known it for some time.\"\\n\\nLavinia sank into the nearest chair. To what depths had her folly led\\nher?\\n\\n\"I shall put no obstacle in the way of your flight, of course....\"\\n\\nThis was dreadful! Lady Lavinia buried her face in her hands and burst\\ninto tears. It was true then--he did not love her--he loved Mrs.\\nFanshawe--_she_ was to elope. She sobbed pitifully as the full horror of\\nthe situation struck her.\\n\\nThe temptation to gather her into his arms almost overmastered Richard,\\nbut he managed to choke it down. If he allowed himself to kiss her, she\\nwould try to break his resolution--mayhap, she would succeed. So he\\nlooked away from her, tortured by the sound of her crying.\\n\\nLavinia wept on, longing to feel his arms about her, ready to consent to\\nanything if only he would show that he loved her. But when he made no\\nmovement towards her, pride came back, and flicking her handkerchief\\nacross her eyes, she rose to her feet.\\n\\n\"You are cruel!--cruel!--cruel! If you do this thing I _shall_ leave\\nyou!\"\\n\\nNow surely he would say something--contradict her!\\n\\nWith an immense effort, Richard controlled himself.\\n\\n\"I am--sorry--Lavinia,\" he said in a queer, constrained voice.\\n\\nIt was of no avail. She had killed his love, and he was longing to be\\nrid of her. She walked to the door, and turned.\\n\\n\"I see that you do not love me,\" she said, with deadly calmness. \"I\\nunderstand perfectly.\" Then, as she wrenched the handle round: \"I hate\\nyou!\" she cried, and fled, her silken skirts rustling furiously down the\\ncorridor. A door slammed in the distance, and there was silence.\\n\\nCarstares stood very still, staring down at her crumpled broidery.\\nPresently he stooped to pick it up, and her violet scent was wafted up\\nto him. He carried it to his lips, passionately.\\n\\nIf Lavinia had been able to see him, it would have changed the whole\\nstate of affairs; as it was she locked herself into her room and\\ncontinued her cry in private. When she had no more tears to shed, she\\nsat up and tried to think that she wanted to elope. Harold would be very\\ngood to her, she was sure, and she would doubtless lead a very exciting\\nlife, but--somehow the more she thought of it, the less she wanted to\\nelope. Then she remembered that Dicky--why had she never realised how\\nmuch she cared for him?--was in love with some horrid widow, and did not\\nwant her to remain with him. The idea was not to be borne, she was not\\ngoing to be the unwanted wife. She would have to go away, though not\\nwith Lovelace. Dicky should _not_ force her to elope with another man.\\nShe would go somewhere alone--she had forgotten--she had no money. The\\ndowry that had been hers was spent years ago. She was utterly dependent\\non her husband. That settled it: she _must_ elope with Harry!\\n\\n\"Oh, was anyone ever so beset!\" she sobbed as her misery swept in upon\\nher with full force. \"Why should I run away if I don\\'t want to?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIII\\n\\nLADY LAVINIA GOES TO THE PLAY\\n\\n\\nRichard was away from home all next day, and his wife had plenty of time\\nin which to meditate upon her situation. She had quite come to the\\nconclusion that she must elope with Lovelace, and was only waiting for\\nto-night to tell him so. She would never, never ask Richard to let her\\nstay with him now that she knew he loved another. Truly a most trying\\npredicament. The Carstares were going to-night to Drury Lane to see\\nGarrick play one of his most successful comedies: the _Beaux\\'\\nStratagem_. The _monde_ that would flock to see the inimitable Archer\\nwas likely to be a very distinguished one, especially as the cast held\\nthe added attraction of Mrs. Clive, and ordinarily Lady Lavinia would\\nhave looked forward with much excitement to seeing the piece. To-day,\\nhowever, she felt that she would far rather go to bed and cry. But\\nLovelace had to be answered, and besides that, she had invited two\\ncousins, new come from Scotland, to accompany her, and she could not\\nfail them.\\n\\nSo that evening saw her seated in her box, wonderfully gowned as usual,\\nscanning the house. Behind her stood her husband--when she thought that\\nthis was the last time she would ever go with him to the theatre she had\\nmuch ado to keep from bursting into tears before them all--and in the\\nchair at her side was the cousin, Mrs. Fleming. Mr. Fleming stood with\\nhis hands behind his back, exclaiming every now and then as his kinsman,\\nyoung Charles Holt, pointed out each newcomer of note. He was a short,\\ntubby little man, dressed in sober brown, very neat as regards his\\nwrists and neckband, but attired, so thought Lavinia, for the country,\\nand not for town. His dark suit contrasted strangely with Mr. Holt\\'s\\nrather garish mixture of apple-green and pink, with waistcoat of yellow,\\nand Richard\\'s quieter, but far more handsome apricot and silver. His\\nwig, too, was not at all modish, being of the scratch type that country\\ngentlemen affected. His wife was the reverse of smart, but she was loud\\nin her admiration of her more affluent cousin\\'s stiff silks and laces.\\n\\nShe had married beneath her, had Mrs. Fleming, and the Belmanoirs had\\nnever quite forgiven the shocking _mesalliance_. William Fleming was\\nnought but a simple Scotsman, whose father--even now the family\\nshuddered at the thought--had been a farmer!\\n\\nLavinia was not over-pleased that they should have elected to visit\\nLondon, and still less pleased that they should evince such an affection\\nfor the Hon. Richard and his wife.\\n\\n\"Well, to be sure, Lavvy, \\'tis pleasant to sit here and admire all the\\npeople!\" exclaimed Mrs. Fleming, for perhaps the twentieth time. \"I\\ndeclare I am grown positively old-fashioned from having lived for so\\nlong in the country!--yes, my dear, positively old-fashioned! ... I\\ncannot but marvel at the great hoops everyone is wearing! I am sure mine\\nis not half the size of yours, and the lady down there in the stage-box\\nhas one even larger!\"\\n\\nLavinia directed her gaze towards the box in question. At any other time\\nshe would have been annoyed to see that the occupant was Lady Carlyle,\\nher pet rival in all matters of fashion. Now she felt that nothing\\nsignified, and merely remarked that she considered those absurd garlands\\nof roses on the dress quite grotesque.\\n\\nBehind, Holt was directing Mr. Fleming\\'s attention to a box at the back\\nof the house.\\n\\n\"\\'Pon my soul, William! \\'Tis the Duchess of Queensberry and her\\nson--March, you know. I assure you there is no one more amiable in town.\\nWhen I last visited her--\"\\n\\n\"Charles knows well-nigh everyone here,\" remarked Mrs. Fleming\\ningenuously, and wondered why her cousin laughed.\\n\\nWhen the curtain rose on the first act, Lovelace was nowhere to be seen,\\nand Lavinia tried to interest herself in the play. But it is difficult\\nto be interested in anything when one\\'s whole mind is occupied with\\nsomething else far more overwhelming. She was not the only one of the\\nparty that Garrick failed to amuse. Richard sat wretchedly in the shadow\\nof the box, thinking how, in a short while, he would never again conduct\\nhis wife to the theatre and never again sit at her side watching her\\nevery change of expression.\\n\\nIn the first interval Lovelace had still not arrived, but many other\\nacquaintances had arrived and called to see the Carstares. Markham,\\nWilding, Devereux, Sir John Fortescue--all came into the box at\\ndifferent times, paid homage to Lavinia, were introduced to Mrs.\\nFleming, laughed and cracked jokes with the men, and drifted away again.\\n\\nHow was it she had never before realised how much she enjoyed her life?\\nwondered Lavinia. She settled down to listen to the second act, and\\nGarrick\\'s skill caught her interest and held it. For a moment she forgot\\nher woes and clapped as heartily as anyone, laughing as gaily.\\n\\nThe next instant she remembered again, and sank back into unutterable\\ngloom.\\n\\nBut Richard had heard her merry laugh, and his heart was even gloomier\\nthan hers. There was no help for it: Lavinia was delighted at the\\nthought of leaving him.\\n\\nAs the curtain fell, Mrs. Fleming suddenly demanded if it was not Tracy\\nseated in the box over on the other side. Lavinia turned to look. In the\\nbox, alone, sat his Grace, seemingly unaware of her presence.\\n\\n\"Is it not Tracy?\" persisted Mrs. Fleming. \"I remember his face so\\nwell.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" nodded Lavinia, and waved to him.\\n\\nAndover rose, bowed, and left his box. In a few moments he was in their\\nown, kissing his cousin\\'s hand.\\n\\nLavinia now caught sight of Lovelace standing on the floor of the\\ntheatre looking up at her. He, too, disappeared from view, and she\\nguessed that he was coming to speak with her. He had evidently failed to\\nperceive the Duke, who was just a little behind her in the shadow.\\n\\nRichard and Mr. Fleming had left the box, and only Charles Holt\\nremained, engaging Mrs. Fleming\\'s whole attention. If only Tracy would\\ngo! How was she ever to give Lovelace her answer with him sitting there\\nso provokingly.\\n\\nCaptain Lovelace knocked at the door. Carelessly she bade him enter, and\\naffected surprise on seeing him. His Grace looked at her through\\nnarrowed lids, and shot a swift glance at Lovelace, whose discomfiture\\nat finding him there was palpable. Not a trace of emotion was visible on\\nthat impassive countenance, but Lavinia felt her brother\\'s attitude to\\nbe sinister, as if he divined her wishes and was determined to frustrate\\nthem. She watched him smile on Lovelace and beg him to be seated.\\nWhether by accident or design, she was not sure which, he had so placed\\nthe chairs that he himself was between her and the captain. Skilfully\\nhe drew Mrs. Fleming into the conversation, and rearranged his stage.\\n\\nLavinia found herself listening to the amiable Mr. Holt, and out of the\\ntail of her eye observed that Lovelace had fallen a victim to her\\ncousin. She could find no way of speaking to him, and dared not even\\nsignal, so adroitly was his Grace stage-managing the scene. Lavinia was\\nnow quite certain that he was managing it. Somehow he had guessed that\\nshe had arranged to speak to Lovelace to-night, and was determined to\\nprevent her. How he had found out, she could not imagine, but she was\\ntoo well acquainted with him to be surprised. He would never let her\\ndisgrace herself if he could help it--she knew that. In whatever manner\\nhe himself might behave, his sister\\'s conduct must be above reproach; he\\nwould find some means of separating them until he could cause Lovelace\\nto be removed. She did not in the least know how he would contrive to do\\nthis, but she never doubted that he could and would. And then she would\\nhave to stay with Richard--Richard, who did not want her. If only Tracy\\nwould go! Ah! he was rising!\\n\\nHis Grace of Andover begged Captain Lovelace to bear him company in his\\nbox. He would brook no refusal. He bore his captive off in triumph.\\n\\nA minute later Mr. Fleming re-entered the box. The third act had just\\nbegun when Richard re-appeared, and softly took his seat. On went the\\nplay. Neither Tracy nor Lovelace came to the box during the next\\ninterval, and from her point of vantage Lavinia could see that Andrew\\nhad been introduced to the latter. She could guess how cleverly his\\nGrace was keeping the Captain by him....\\n\\nLord Avon, who had only a week ago returned from Bath, came to pay his\\nrespects. He had much to tell dear Lady Lavinia. How Cholmondely and\\nFalmouth had dared to fight a duel in Crescent Fields, and had been\\narrested. How furious the Beau was, but how his age was beginning to\\ntell on him, and how it was whispered that his power was waning. All of\\nwhich at any ordinary time would have interested my lady quite\\nprodigiously, but now bored and even annoyed her.\\n\\nOn went the play. Scrub and Boniface kept the house in a roar; all but\\nRichard and his wife were enthralled. The incomparable Kitty failed to\\nhold Lavinia\\'s attention. Would Lovelace manage to speak to her in the\\nlast interval? A solicitous enquiry from Mrs. Fleming roused her, and\\nshe had perforce to smile--to own to a slight headache, and to evince\\nsome interest in the play. One more interval: would he come? She became\\naware of a hand laid on her shoulder. Richard\\'s voice, gravely\\ncourteous, sounded in her ears.\\n\\n\"You are heated, my dear. Will you walk outside a little?\"\\n\\nShe felt a mad desire to cling to his hand, and suppressed it forcibly.\\nShe rose, hesitating. Mrs. Fleming decided the point.\\n\\n\"The very thing. How considerate of you, Mr. Carstares! I shall like to\\nwalk amongst all the people, to be sure! Here is Charles offering to\\nescort us, too! What say you, Lavvy?\"\\n\\n\"I--oh, I shall be pleased to do what suits you best, cousin,\" she\\nanswered.\\n\\n\"Then let us go, my love. Charles has an arm for each, so we may leave\\nour husbands to chat.\"\\n\\nThey went out into the broad passage and walked towards the foyer. There\\nLord March espied Lavinia, who was always a favourite with him, and came\\nforward, offering his arm. Lavinia took it, thankful to escape from Mr.\\nHolt\\'s vapid conversation. She let March conduct her to where his mother\\nwas sitting, with Mr. Selwyn at her elbow. Someone fetched her a glass\\nof ratafie, and Montagu came to talk to her.\\n\\nStepping out of his box, Richard fell into the arms of his Grace of\\nAndover.\\n\\n\"Ah! Dick!\"\\n\\nRichard eyed him coldly.\\n\\n\"You wanted me?\"\\n\\nTracy saw Mr. Fleming approaching\\n\\n\"Only to ask if I may return with you to Grosvenor Square. I have\\nsomething important to say.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" bowed Richard, and turned aside.\\n\\nLovelace, who had succeeded in escaping from the Belmanoir claws,\\nhurried in search of Lavinia. Not finding her in her box, he gathered\\nshe must be in the foyer and made his way towards it. As soon as she saw\\nhim coming she set down her glass and rose to her feet.\\n\\n\"Oh, Captain Lovelace! Have you come to fetch me back to my seat? I have\\nscarce set eyes on you this evening. No, Markham, you may _not_ come!\\nNo, nor you, my lord! Madam--\" She curtsied low to the old Duchess and\\nwalked away on Harold\\'s arm.\\n\\nWhen they were once in the deserted passage behind the boxes, he turned\\neagerly towards her.\\n\\n\"Well, my dearest? Well?\"\\n\\nLady Lavinia\\'s mouth drooped miserably.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I shall have to come with you.\"\\n\\nThe tone was damping, to say the least of it, but he did not seem to\\nnotice it.\\n\\n\"Lavinia! You mean it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she assented, still more dejectedly.\\n\\n\"My beautiful love! You will really come? When? At once?\"\\n\\n\"At--Oh, no, no!\"\\n\\n\"Darling, the sooner the better. I understand \\'tis a great step to\\nexpect you to take in a hurry, but I assure you \\'tis wisest. Can you\\ncome to-morrow?\"\\n\\nHer big eyes dilated.\\n\\n\"No! No! I--oh, I cannot leave Dicky so soon!\" She ended with a sob.\\n\\n\"But, Lavinia, my dearest! You surely do not want to _stay_ with him?\"\\nhe cried.\\n\\n\"Yes I do!\" she answered. \"I--I don\\'t want ever to leave him!\"\\n\\nThis blighting speech left him gasping.\\n\\n\"You--but--heavens! what are you saying? You love _me_!\"\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t!\" she contradicted. \"I always s-said I d-didn\\'t. I love my\\nhusband!\"\\n\\n\"You are distraught!\" he exclaimed. \"If you love him, why do you consent\\nto elope with me?\"\\n\\nShe looked at him reproachfully.\\n\\n\"There is no one else,\" she said mournfully.\\n\\n\"Good Lord! What--\"\\n\\n\"I have to elope with someone--because--Dick--d-doesn\\'t love me any\\nmore--you see. I will come with you, and I will try to be good.\"\\n\\nHe kissed her hand quickly\\n\\n\"Sweetheart! ... I still think you are not yourself. You will think\\ndifferently to-morrow--you do not really love Carstares.\"\\n\\nShe shut her mouth obstinately, tilting her regal little head.\\n\\nHe watched her anxiously.\\n\\n\"If you really do love him, \\'tis ridiculous to elope with me,\" he said.\\n\\nHer fingers tightened on his wrist.\\n\\n\"But I must! You don\\'t understand, Harry! You _must_ take me! Don\\'t you\\nwant me?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I do, but not if you are longing to be somewhere else all the\\ntime. The whole thing seems preposterous!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis all dreadful!--dreadful! I have never been so unhappy in my life!\\nI--oh, I wish I had not been so heedless and selfish!\"\\n\\nLovelace pondered for a moment, as they stood outside her box; then,\\nseeing that people were returning to their seats, he opened the door and\\ntook her in.\\n\\n\"Listen, dear! This is the maddest scheme ever I heard; but if you are\\ndetermined, you shall carry it through. Come to my lodgings to-morrow\\nevening! Bring as little baggage as possible; I will have all ready, and\\nwe will post at once to Dover. Then in time I hope you will forget\\nRichard and come to care for me a little.\"\\n\\n\"You are very, very good, Harry! Yes, I will do just as you say and, oh,\\nI am sorry to put you out like this! I am nought but a plague to\\neveryone, and I wish I were dead! You don\\'t really love me, and I shall\\nbe a burden!\"\\n\\n\"I do indeed love you!\" he assured her, but within himself he could not\\nhelp wishing that he had not fallen quite so passionately in love with\\nher. \"I\\'ll leave you now, sweet, for your husband will be returning at\\nany moment.\" He kissed her hands lightly \"_A demain_, fairest!\"\\n\\nHow she sat through the last act Lavinia could never afterwards imagine.\\nShe was longing to be at home--so soon to be home no longer--and quiet.\\nHer head ached now as Richard\\'s had ached for weeks. More than anything\\ndid she want to rest it against her husband\\'s shoulder, so temptingly\\nnear, and to feel his sheltering arms about her. But Dick was in love\\nwith Isabella Fanshawe, and she must sit straight and stiff in her chair\\nand smile at the proper places.\\n\\nAt last the play was ended! The curtain descended on the bowing Archer,\\nand the house stamped and clapped its appreciation. The curtain rose\\nagain--what! not finished yet? Ah, no! it was but Garrick leading Mrs.\\nClive forward. Would they never have done?\\n\\nMrs. Fleming was standing; she supposed they were going, and got up.\\nSomeone put her cloak about her shoulders; Richard--for the last time.\\nMr. Holt escorted her to her coach, and put her and her cousin into it.\\nHe and Mr. Fleming had their chairs; so only Richard and Tracy went with\\nthe ladies. The Flemings were staying with friends in Brook Street, just\\noff Grosvenor Square, so that when they had put Harriet down, only a few\\nmore yards remained to be covered.\\n\\nLavinia wondered dully why Tracy had elected to come with them. What did\\nhe want? Was he going to warn Dick of her intended flight? He little\\nknew the true state of affairs!\\n\\nAt the foot of the staircase at Wyncham House she turned to say\\ngood-night.\\n\\nShe merely nodded to Tracy, but to Dick she extended her hand. He took\\nit in his, kissing it, and she noticed how cold were his fingers, how\\nburning hot his lips. Then he released her, and she went slowly up the\\nstairs to her room.\\n\\nHis Grace watched her through his eyeglass. When she was out of sight he\\nturned and surveyed Richard critically.\\n\\n\"If that is the way you kiss a woman, Lavinia has my sympathies,\" he\\nremarked.\\n\\nRichard\\'s lips tightened. He picked up a stand of lighted candles and\\nushered his Grace into the drawing-room.\\n\\n\"I presume you did not come to tell me that?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Your presumption is correct, Richard. I have come to open your eyes.\"\\n\\n\"You are too kind.\"\\n\\nHis Grace laid his hat on the table, and sat down on the arm of a chair.\\n\\n\"I think perhaps I am. It may interest you to hear that Lavinia intends\\nto elope with our gallant friend the Captain.\" Richard bowed.\\n\\n\"You knew it?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\nAndover looked him over.\\n\\n\"May I ask what steps you are taking to prevent her?\"\\n\\n\"None.\"\\n\\nHis Grace\\'s expression was quite indescribable. For a moment he was\\nspeechless, and then he reverted to heavy sarcasm.\\n\\n\"Pray remember to be at hand--to conduct her to her chair!\" he drawled.\\n\"Upon my soul, you sicken me!\\n\\n\"I am grieved. There is a remedy,\" replied Carstares significantly.\\n\\nTracy ignored the suggestion.\\n\\n\"I suppose it is nothing to you that you lose her? No; It is nothing to\\nyou that she disgraces her name? Oh, no!\"\\n\\n\"_My_ name, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Our name! Is it possible for her to disgrace yours?\"\\n\\nRichard went white and his hand flew instinctively to his sword hilt.\\n\\nTracy looked at him.\\n\\n\"Do you think I would soil my blade with you?\" he asked, very softly.\\n\\nRichard\\'s hand fell from the hilt: his eyes searched the other\\'s face.\\n\\n\"You know?\" he asked at last, quite calmly.\\n\\n\"You fool,\" answered his Grace gently. \"You fool, do you think I have\\nnot always known?\"\\n\\nRichard leaned against the mantel-shelf.\\n\\n\"You never thought I was innocent? You knew that night? You guessed?\"\\n\\nThe Duke sneered.\\n\\n\"Knowing both, could I suspect other than you?\" he asked insultingly.\\n\\n\"Oh, my God!\" cried Carstares suddenly. \"Why could you not have said so\\nbefore?\"\\n\\nThe Duke\\'s eyes opened wide.\\n\\n\"It has chafed you--eh? I knew it would. I\\'ve watched you.\" He chuckled\\nbeneath his breath. \"And those fools never looked beneath the surface.\\nOne and all, they believed that John would cheat. John! They swallowed\\nit tamely and never even guessed at the truth.\"\\n\\n\"You, at least, did not believe?\"\\n\\n\"I? Hardly. Knowing you for a weak fool and him for a quixotic fool, I\\nrather jumped to conclusions.\"\\n\\n\"Instead, you tried to throw the blame on him. I would to God you had\\nexposed me!\"\\n\\n\"So you have remarked. I confess I do not understand this heroic\\nattitude. Why should I interfere in what was none of my business? What\\nproof had I?\"\\n\\n\"Why did you raise no demur? What motive had you?\"\\n\\n\"I should have thought it fairly obvious.\"\\n\\nRichard stared at him, puzzled.\\n\\n\"Gad, Richard! but you are singularly obtuse. Have I not pointed out\\nthat John was a quixotic fool? When did I say he was a weak one?\"\\n\\n\"You mean--you mean you wanted Lavinia to marry me--because you thought\\nto squeeze me as you willed?\" asked Carstares slowly.\\n\\nHis Grace\\'s thin nostrils wrinkled up.\\n\\n\"You are so crude,\" he complained.\\n\\n\"It suited you that Jack should be disgraced? You thought I should seize\\nhis money. You--you--\"\\n\\n\"Rogue? But you will admit that I at least am an honest rogue. You\\nare--er--a dishonest saint. I would sooner be what I am.\"\\n\\n\"I know there is nothing on God\\'s earth more vile than I am!\" replied\\nCarstares, violently.\\n\\nHis Grace sneered openly.\\n\\n\"Very pretty, Richard, but a little tardy, methinks.\" He paused, and\\nsomething seemed to occur to him. \"\\'Tis why you purpose to let Lavinia\\ngo, I suppose? You confess the truth on Friday--eh?\"\\n\\nRichard bowed his head.\\n\\n\"I have not the right to stop her. She--chooses her own road.\"\\n\\n\"She knows?\" sharply.\\n\\n\"She has always known.\"\\n\\n\"The jade! And I never guessed it!\" He paused. \"Yes, I understand your\\nheroic attitude. I am sorry I cannot pander to it. In spite of all this,\\nI cannot permit my sister to ruin herself.\"\\n\\n\"She were as effectually ruined an she stayed with me.\"\\n\\n\"Pshaw! After seven years, who is like to care one way or the other\\nwhich of you cheated? Play the man for once and stop her!\"\\n\\n\"She _loves_ Lovelace, I tell you!\"\\n\\n\"What of it? She will recover from that.\"\\n\\n\"No--I cannot ask her to stay with me--\\'twould be damnably selfish.\"\\n\\nHis Grace appeared exasperated.\\n\\n\"\\'Fore Gad, you are a fool! Ask her! _Ask_ her! Force her! Kick Lovelace\\nfrom your house and abandon the heroic pose, I beg of you!\"\\n\\n\"Do you suppose I want to lose her?\" cried Carstares. \"\\'Tis because I\\nlove her so much that I will not stand in the way of her happiness!\"\\n\\nThe Duke flung round and picked up his hat.\\n\\n\"I am sorry I cannot join with you in your heroics. I must take the\\nmatter into my own hands, as usual, it seems. Lord, but you should have\\nlearnt to make her obey you, my good Dick! She has led you by the nose\\never since she married you, and she was a woman who wanted mastering!\"\\nHe went over to the door and opened it. \"I will call upon you to-morrow,\\nwhen I shall hope to find you more sane. They do not purpose to leave\\nuntil late, I know, for Lovelace is promised to Mallaby at three\\no\\'clock. There is time in which to act.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not interfere,\" repeated Richard.\\n\\nHis Grace sneered.\\n\\n\"So you have remarked. It remains for me to do. Good-night.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIV\\n\\nRICHARD PLAYS THE MAN\\n\\n\\nLady Lavinia\\'s frame of mind when she awoke next morning was hardly\\nbefitting one who contemplated an elopement. A weight seemed to rest on\\nher chest, hopeless misery was gathered about her head. She could not\\nbring herself to drink her chocolate, and, feeling that inaction was the\\nworst of all, she very soon crawled out of bed and allowed her maid to\\ndress her. Then she went with dragging steps to her boudoir, wondering\\nall the time where Richard was and what he was doing. She seated herself\\nat her window and looked out on to the square, biting the edge of her\\nhandkerchief in the effort to keep back her tears.\\n\\nRichard was in a no more cheerful mood. He, too, left his chocolate\\nuntouched, and went presently down to the breakfast table and looked at\\nthe red sirloin with a feeling of acute nausea. He managed to drink a\\ncup of coffee, and immediately afterwards left the room and made his way\\nto his wife\\'s boudoir. He told himself he was acting weakly, and had far\\nbetter avoid her, but in the end he gave way to his longing to see her,\\nand knocked on one white panel.\\n\\nLavinia\\'s heart leapt. How well she knew that knock!\\n\\n\"Come in!\" she called, and tried to compose her features.\\n\\nRichard entered and shut the door behind him.\\n\\n\"Oh--oh--good-morning!\" she smiled. \"You--wanted to speak with\\nme--Dick?\"\\n\\n\"I--yes--that is--er--have you the Carlyles\\' invitation?\"\\n\\nIt was, perhaps, an unlucky excuse. Lavinia turned away and fought\\nagainst her tears.\\n\\n\"I--I believe--\\'tis in my--escritoire,\" she managed to say. \"I--I will\\nlook for it.\"\\n\\nShe rose and unlocked the bureau, standing with her back to him.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis no matter,\" stammered Carstares. \"I--only--\\'twas but that I could\\nnot find it. Pray do not disturb yourself!\"\\n\\n\"Oh--not--at all,\" she answered, scattering a handful of letters before\\nher. \"Yes--here \\'tis.\" She came up to him with the note in her hand,\\nextending it.\\n\\nCarstares looked down at the golden head, and at the little face with\\nits eyes cast down, and red mouth set so wistfully. Heavens, how could\\nhe bear to live without her! Mechanically he took the letter.\\n\\nLavinia turned away, and as she stepped from him something snapped in\\nRichard\\'s brain. The luckless invitation was flung down.\\n\\n\"No, by God you shall not!\" he cried suddenly.\\n\\nLavinia stopped, trembling.\\n\\n\"Oh--oh, what do you mean?\" she fluttered.\\n\\nThe mists were gone from his mind now, everything was clear. Lavinia\\nshould not elope with Lovelace. In two strides he was at her side, had\\ncaught her by the shoulders and swung her to face him.\\n\\n\"You shall not leave me! Do you understand? I cannot live without you!\"\\n\\nLavinia gave a little cry full of relief, joy and wonderment, and shrank\\nagainst him.\\n\\n\"Oh, please, please forgive me and keep me with you!\" she cried, and\\nclung to the lapels of his coat.\\n\\nCarstares swept her right off the ground in the violence of his embrace,\\nbut she did not mind, although the crushing was ruinous to her silks.\\nSilks were no longer uppermost in her brain. She returned his kisses\\neagerly, sobbing a little.\\n\\nWhen Carstares was able to say anything beyond how he loved her, he\\ndemanded if she did not love him?\\n\\n\"Of course I do!\" she cooed. \"I always, always did, only I was so\\nselfish and so careless!\"\\n\\nHe carried her to the sofa and sat down with her on his knee, trying to\\nlook into her face. But she had somehow contrived to hide it on his\\nshoulder, and he did not succeed.\\n\\n\"Then you never loved that puppy?\" he asked, amazed.\\n\\nOne hand crept up to his other shoulder.\\n\\n\"Oh, Dicky, no! And--and you--you don\\'t love that horrid Mrs. Fanshawe,\\ndo you?\"\\n\\nHe was still more amazed.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Fanshawe? Great heavens, no! You never thought that, surely?\"\\n\\n\"I did--I did! Since you were always at her house, and so cold to\\nme--how could I help it?\"\\n\\n\"Cold to _you_? My dearest, surely not?\"\\n\\n\"You were--you truly were--and I was so miserable--I--I thought I had\\nbeen so unreasonable and so horrid that you had ceased to I-love me--and\\nI did not know what to do. And--and then you told me that you were going\\nto--to confess--and I lost my temper and said I would n-not stay with\\nyou--But I never, never meant it--and when you seemed to expect me to\\ngo--I--I did not know what to do again!\"\\n\\nHe patted her shoulder comfortingly.\\n\\n\"Sweetheart, don\\'t cry! I had no idea of all this--why, I was sure that\\nyou loved Lovelace--I never doubted it--why in the world did you not\\ntell me the truth?\"\\n\\nShe sat up at that, and looked at him.\\n\\n\"Why, how could I?\" she demanded. \"I was quite certain that you loved\\nIsabella Fanshawe. I felt I had to go away, and I could not do it\\nalone--so--so--so, of course I had to elope. And I told Harold last\\nnight that I would go with him--and I\\'m afraid he didn\\'t quite want me\\nwhen he heard that I loved you. Oh, Dicky darling, you\\'ll tell him that\\nI won\\'t go with him, won\\'t you?\"\\n\\nHe could not help laughing.\\n\\n\"Ay, I\\'ll tell him. \\'Pon rep., sweetheart, I can find it in me to be\\nsorry for him!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he will not mind for long,\" she said philosophically. \"He loves so\\n_easily_, you see! But you, Dick--why did you go so often--so _very_\\noften to see Mrs. Fanshawe?\"\\n\\nHis face grew solemn.\\n\\n\"She knew--Jack--in Vienna--I--I wanted to hear all she could tell me of\\nhim--I could think of nothing else.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Dicky! How--how wickedly foolish I have been! And \\'twas that that\\nmade you so cold--and I thought--oh, dear!\"\\n\\nHe drew her head down on to his shoulder again.\\n\\n\"My poor love! Why, \\'tis the kindest lady imaginable, but as to loving\\nher--!\" He kissed her hand lingeringly. \"I love--and have always\\nloved--a far different being: a naughty, wilful, captivating little\\nperson, who--\"\\n\\nLady Lavinia clasped her arms about his neck.\\n\\n\"You make me feel so very, very dreadful! I have indeed been\\nnaughty--I--\"\\n\\n\"And you\\'ll be so many times again,\" he told her, laughing.\\n\\n\"No, no! I--will--try to be good!\"\\n\\n\"I do not want you good!\" Richard assured her. \"I want you to be your\\nown dear self!\" ... Lady Lavinia disengaged herself with a contented\\nlittle sigh, and stood up.\\n\\n\"How charming it is to be happy again, to be sure!\" she remarked\\nnaively. \"To think that only half an hour ago I was wishing to be dead!\"\\nShe went over to the glass and straightened her hair.\\n\\nRichard looked at her rather anxiously.\\n\\n\"Lavinia--you--you quite understand, I am going to tell everyone the\\ntruth--next Friday?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes, I do, of course--\\'tis dreadfully disagreeable of you, but I\\nsuppose you will do it. I do _hope_ people will not refuse to recognise\\nus, though.\"\\n\\n\"No one would ever refuse to recognise you, dearest.\"\\n\\nShe brightened.\\n\\n\"Do you really think so? Well, perhaps after all, \\'twill not be so\\n_very_ horrid. And--and you will like to have Jack again, won\\'t you?\\nYes--I knew you would. Oh, \\'twill all be quite comfortable after a\\nlittle while, I make no doubt!\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nHis Grace of Andover arose betimes, and early sallied forth into the\\nstreet. He called a chair, and drove to an address in the Strand, where\\nlodged a certain Colonel Shepherd. Half-an-hour did he spend with the\\nColonel, and when he at length emerged from the house the curl of his\\nlip betokened satisfaction. He did not at once hail a chair, but walked\\nalong in the direction of St. James\\'s, entering the park in company\\nwith one Dare, who, seven years before, had given a certain memorable\\ncard-party.\\n\\nDare was pleasantly intrigued over Richard\\'s latest oddity.\\n\\n\"Have you an idea what \\'tis about, Belmanoir?\" he inquired. \"Has he\\nwritten you to come as well?\"\\n\\n\"I believe I did receive some communication from Carstares; yes--I\\nremember, Andrew brought it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what does it mean? Fortescue is bidden, and Davenant. \\'Tis very\\ncurious.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Dare, I am not in Richard\\'s confidence. We shall doubtless hear\\nall that there is to hear at the given time. Mysteries do not interest\\nme. But \\'twill be a pleasant reunion.... Fortescue and Davenant, you\\nsay? Strange! I have heard that Evans and Milward have also received\\ntheir sum--invitations. It should be most entertaining.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis prodigious curious,\" repeated Dare. \"No one can imagine what \\'tis\\nall about!\"\\n\\n\"Ah?\" His Grace\\'s thin lips twitched.\\n\\nMidway through the afternoon he repaired to Wyncham House and was\\nushered into the library.\\n\\nRichard sat writing, but rose on seeing him, and came forward.\\n\\nIt struck his Grace that Carstares was looking quite happy.\\n\\n\"You seem cheerful, Richard!\"\\n\\n\"I am,\" smiled his brother-in-law.\\n\\n\"I am much relieved to hear it. I have seen Shepherd.\"\\n\\n\"Shepherd?\" interrogated Carstares.\\n\\n\"Lovelace\\'s colonel, my dear Richard. You may count on Captain Harold\\'s\\ndeparture--on an important mission--in, say, forty-eight hours.\"\\n\\n\"You may count on Captain Harold\\'s departure in very much less, Tracy,\"\\nsaid Carstares, a twinkle in his eye.\\n\\nThe Duke started forward.\\n\\n\"She has gone?\" he almost hissed.\\n\\n\"Gone? No! She is in the drawing-room with him.\"\\n\\n\"With Lovelace! And you permit it? You stand by and watch another man--\"\\n\\n\"Say farewell to my wife. But I am not watching it, as you see.\"\\n\\nThe anger died out of his Grace\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"Farewell? Do you tell me you at last came to your senses?\"\\n\\n\"We found that we both laboured under a delusion,\" replied Carstares\\npleasantly.\\n\\n\"I am delighted to hear you say so. I hope you will for the future keep\\na stricter hold over Lavinia.\"\\n\\n\"Do you?\"\\n\\n\"I do. I think I will not undo what I have done; Lovelace were perhaps\\nbetter out of the way for a time.\"\\n\\n\"Why, I have no objection to that,\" bowed Richard.\\n\\nHis Grace nodded shortly and picked up his hat.\\n\\n\"Then there remains nothing more to be done in the matter.\"\\n\\nHe looked piercingly across at Carstares. \"She did not love him?\"\\n\\nRichard gave a happy little sigh.\\n\\n\"She loves me.\"\\n\\nThe heavy lids drooped again.\\n\\n\"You cannot conceive my delight. If she indeed loves you, she is safe. I\\nthought she had not got it in her. Pray bear my respects to her.\" His\\nhand was on the door-knob, when something seemed to occur to him.\\n\\n\"I take it my presence at Wyncham on Friday will not be necessary?\" he\\nsaid cynically.\\n\\nRichard flushed.\\n\\n\"It will not be necessary.\"\\n\\n\"Then I am sure you will excuse me an I do not appear. I have other,\\nmore important affairs on hand.....But I shall be loth to miss the\\nheroics,\" he added pensively, and chuckled. \"_Au revoir,_ my good\\nRichard!\"\\n\\nRichard bowed him out thankfully.\\n\\nPresently the front door opened and shut again, and looking out of the\\nwindow he saw that Captain Harold Lovelace had taken his departure.\\n\\nHe was now awaiting Mr. Warburton, whom he had sent in search of John\\nsome days ago. He should have been here by now, he thought, but perhaps\\nhe had been detained. Richard was aching to hear news of his brother,\\nlonging to see him once more. But at the same time he was dreading the\\nmeeting; he shrank from the thought of looking into Jack\\'s eyes,\\ncold--even scornful. It was not possible, so he reasoned, that Jack\\nshould feel no resentment....\\n\\n\"Mr. Warburton, sir.\"\\n\\nCarstares turned and came eagerly forward to greet the newcomer.\\n\\n\"Well? Well?\"\\n\\nMr. Warburton spread out deprecating hands.\\n\\n\"Alas! Mr. Carstares.\"\\n\\nRichard caught his arm.\\n\\n\"What mean you? He is not--dead?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You could not find him? Quick! Tell me?\"\\n\\n\"Alas! no, sir.\"\\n\\n\"But the Chequers--he said--Surely they knew something?\"\\n\\n\"Nought, Mr. Carstares.\" Out came Mr. Warburton\\'s snuff-box. Very\\ndeliberately he took a pinch, shaking the remains from his finger-tips.\\n\"The host, Chadber--an honest man, though lacking in humour--has not set\\neyes on my lord for well-nigh six months. Not since I went to advise my\\nlord of the Earl\\'s death.\"\\n\\n\"But Warburton, he cannot be far? He is not dead! Oh, surely not that?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, Master Dick,\" soothed the lawyer. \"We should have heard of it\\nhad he been killed. I fear he has gone abroad once more. It seems he\\noften spoke of travelling again.\"\\n\\n\"Abroad? God! don\\'t let me lose him again!\" He sank into a chair, his\\nhead in his arms.\\n\\n\"Tut! I implore you, Mr. Carstares! Do not despair yet. We have no proof\\nthat he has left the country. I daresay we shall find him almost at\\nonce. Chadber thinks it likely he will visit the inn again ere long.\\nCalm yourself, Master Dick!\" He walked up to the man and laid a hand on\\none heaving shoulder. \"We shall find him, never fear! But do not--I know\\n\\'twould grieve him to see you so upset, Master Dick--pray, do not--!\"\\n\\n\"If I could only make amends!\" groaned Richard.\\n\\n\"Well, sir, are you not about to? He would not wish you to distress\\nyourself like this! He was so fond of you! Pray, pray do not!\"\\n\\nCarstares rose unsteadily and walked to the window. \"I crave your\\npardon, Mr. Warburton--you must excuse me--I have been--living in\\nhell--this last week.\"\\n\\nWarburton came over to his side.\\n\\n\"Master Dick--I--you know I have never cared for you-as--well--as--\"\\n\\n\"You cared for him.\"\\n\\n\"Er--yes, sir, exactly!--and of late years I may, perhaps, have been\\nhard. I would desire to--er--apologise for any unjust--er--thoughts I\\nmay have harboured against you. I--I--possibly, I never quite\\nunderstood. That is all, sir.\"\\n\\nHe blew his nose rather violently, and then his hand found Richard\\'s.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nRichard Carstares had plenty to occupy him for the rest of the week.\\nArrangements had to be made, a house acquired for Lavinia, Wyncham House\\nto be thoroughly cleaned and put in order, awaiting its rightful owner.\\nOnce she had made up her mind to face the inevitable, Lavinia quite\\nenjoyed all the preparations. The new house in Great Jermyn Street she\\nvoted charming, and she straightway set to work to buy very expensive\\nfurniture for it, and to superintend all the alterations. In her present\\npenitent mood she would even have accompanied her husband to Wyncham on\\nMonday, to stand by him on the fateful Friday; but this he would not\\nallow, insisting that she remain in town until his return. So she\\nfluttered contentedly from Grosvenor Square to Jermyn Street, very busy\\nand quite happy.\\n\\nCarstares was to travel to Wyncham on Monday, arriving there the\\nfollowing evening in company with Andrew, whom he was taking as far as\\nAndover. His lordship had lately embroiled himself in a quarrel over a\\nlady when deep in his cups, and owing to the subsequent duel at Barn\\nElms and the almost overpowering nature of his debts, he deemed it\\nprudent to go into seclusion for a spell. Tracy disappeared from town in\\nthe middle of the week, whither no one knew, but it was universally\\nbelieved that he had gone to Scotland on a visit.\\n\\nMonday at length dawned fair and promising. After bidding his wife a\\nvery tender farewell, and gently drying her wet eyelashes with his own\\nhandkerchief, Richard set out with his brother-in-law in the big\\ntravelling chaise soon after noon. Andrew had quite recovered his\\nhitherto rather dampened spirits, and produced a dice-box from one\\npocket and a pack of cards from the other wherewith to beguile the\\ntedium of the journey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXV\\n\\nHIS GRACE OF ANDOVER CAPTURES THE QUEEN\\n\\n\\nDiana stood in the old oak porch, riding-whip in hand, and the folds of\\nher voluminous gown over her arm. Miss Betty stood beside her, surveying\\nher with secret pride.\\n\\nDiana\\'s eyes seemed darker than ever, she thought, and the mouth more\\ntragic. She knew that the girl was, to use her own expression, \"moping\\nquite prodigiously for that Mr. Carr.\" Not all that she could do to\\nentertain Diana entirely chased away the haunting sadness in her face;\\nfor a time she would be gay, but afterwards the laughter died away and\\nshe was silent. Many times had Miss Betty shaken her fist at the absent\\nJohn.\\n\\nPresently Diana gave a tiny sigh, and looked down at her aunt, smiling.\\n\\n\"You would be surprised how excellently well Harper manages the horses,\"\\nshe said. \"He is quite a godsend. So much nicer than that stupid\\nWilliam.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, yes,\" agreed Miss Betty. \"Only think, my dear, he was groom to\\nSir Hugh Grandison--I saw the letter Sir Hugh writ your Papa--a\\nremarkable elegant epistle, I assure you, my love.\"\\n\\nDiana nodded and watched the new groom ride up, leading her mount. He\\njumped down, and, touching his hat, stood awaiting his mistress\\'s\\npleasure.\\n\\nDiana went up to the cob, patting his glossy neck.\\n\\n\"We are going towards Ashley to-day, aunt,\" she said. \"I am so anxious\\nto find some berries, and Harper tells me they grow in profusion not far\\nfrom here.\"\\n\\n\"Now, my dear, pray do not tire yourself by going too far--I doubt it\\nwill rain before long and you will catch your death of cold!\"\\n\\nDiana laughed at her.\\n\\n\"Oh, no, aunt! Why, the sky is almost cloudless! But we shall not be\\nlong, I promise you. Only as far as Crossdown Woods and back again.\"\\n\\nShe gave her foot to the groom just as Mr. Beauleigh came out to watch\\nher start.\\n\\n\"Really, my dear, I must ride with you to-morrow,\" he told her. \"\\'Tis an\\nage since we have been out together.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Papa, will you not accompany me this afternoon?\" cried Diana\\neagerly. \"I should so like it!\"\\n\\nIt struck her aunt that Harper awaited the answer to this question\\nrather anxiously. She watched him, puzzled. However, when Mr. Beauleigh\\nhad refused she could not see any change in his expression, and\\nconcluded that she must have been mistaken.\\n\\nSo with a wave of her hand, Diana rode away, the groom following at a\\nrespectful distance. Yet somehow Miss Betty was uneasy. A presentiment\\nof evil seemed to touch her, and when the riders had disappeared round a\\nbend in the road she felt an insane desire to run after them and call\\nher niece back. She gave herself a little shake, saying that she was a\\nfond old woman, over-anxious about Diana. Nevertheless, she laid a\\ndetaining hand on her brother\\'s arm as he was about to go indoors.\\n\\n\"Wait, Horace! You--you _will_ ride with Di more frequently, will you\\nnot?\"\\n\\nHe looked surprised.\\n\\n\"You are uneasy, Betty?\"\\n\\n\"Oh--uneasy--! Well, yes--a little. I do not like her to go alone with a\\ngroom, and we do not know this man.\"\\n\\n\"My dear! I had the very highest references from Sir Hugh Grandison,\\nwho, I am sure, would never recommend anyone untrustworthy. Why, you saw\\nthe letter yourself!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes. Doubtless I am very stupid. But you _will_ ride with her\\nafter to-day, will you not?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly I will accompany my daughter when I can spare the time,\" he\\nreplied with dignity, and with that she had to be content.\\n\\nDiana rode leisurely along the lane, beside great trees and hedges that\\nwere a blaze of riotous colour. Autumn had turned the leaves dull gold\\nand flame, mellow brown and deepest red, with flaming orange\\nintermingled, and touches of copper here and there where some beech tree\\nstood. The lane was like a fairy picture, too gorgeous to be real; the\\ntrees, meeting overhead, but let the sunlight through in patches, so\\nthat the dusty road beneath was mottled with gold.\\n\\nThe hedges retained their greenness, and where there was a gap a vista\\nof fields presented itself. And then they came upon a clump of berries,\\nblack and red, growing the other side of the little stream that\\nmeandered along the lane in a ditch. Diana drew up and addressed her\\ncompanion.\\n\\n\"See, Harper--there are berries! We need go no further.\" She changed the\\nreins to her right hand and made as if to spring down.\\n\\n\"The place I spoke of is but a short way on, miss,\" ventured the man,\\nkeeping his seat.\\n\\nShe paused.\\n\\n\"But why will these not suffice?\"\\n\\n\"Well, miss, if you like. But those others were a deal finer. It seems a\\npity not to get some.\"\\n\\nDiana looked doubtfully along the road.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis not far?\"\\n\\n\"No, miss; but another quarter of a mile, and then down the track by the\\nwood.\"\\n\\nStill she hesitated.\\n\\n\"I do not want to be late,\" she demurred.\\n\\n\"No, miss, of course not. I only thought as how we might come back by\\nway of Chorly Fields.\"\\n\\n\"Round by the mill? H\\'m....\"\\n\\n\"Yes, miss. Then as soon as we get past it there is a clear stretch of\\nturf almost up to the house.\"\\n\\nHer eye brightened.\\n\\n\"A gallop? Very well! But let us hurry on.\"\\n\\nShe touched the cob with her heel, and they trotted on briskly out of\\nthe leafy canopy along the road with blue sky above and pasture land\\naround. After a little while the wood came in sight, and in a minute\\nthey were riding down the track at right angles to the road. Harper was\\nat Diana\\'s heels, drawing nearer. Half unconsciously she quickened her\\npace. There was not a soul in sight.\\n\\nThey were coming to a bend in the road, and now Harper was alongside.\\n\\nChoking a ridiculous feeling of frightened apprehension, Diana drew\\nrein.\\n\\n\"I do not perceive those berries!\" she said lightly.\\n\\n\"No, miss,\" was the immediate response. \"They are just a step into the\\nwood. If you care to dismount here I can show you.\"\\n\\nNothing could be more respectful than the man\\'s tone. Diana shook off\\nher nervous qualms and slipped down. Harper, already on the ground, took\\nthe cob\\'s rein and tied both horses to a tree.\\n\\nDiana gathered her skirts over her arm and picked her way through the\\nbrambles to where he had pointed.\\n\\nThe blackberry hedges he held back for her entrance swung back after\\nthey had passed, completely shutting out all view of the road. There\\nwere no berries.\\n\\nDiana\\'s heart was beating very fast, all her suspicions springing to\\nlife again, but she showed no sign of fear as she desired him to hold\\nthe brambles back again for her to pass out.\\n\\n\"For there are no berries here, as you can see for yourself.\"\\n\\nShe swept round and walked calmly towards the bushes.\\n\\nThen, how she could never quite remember, she was seized from behind,\\nand before she had time to move, a long piece of silk was flung over her\\nhead and drawn tight across her mouth, while an arm, as of steel, held\\nand controlled her.\\n\\nFighting madly, she managed to get one arm free, and struck out\\nfuriously with her slender crop. There was a brief struggle, and it was\\ntwisted from her grasp, and her hands tied behind her, despite all her\\nefforts to be free.\\n\\nThen her captor swung her writhing into his arms, and strode away\\nthrough the wood without a word.\\n\\nDiana was passive now, reserving her strength for when it might avail\\nher something, but above the gag her eyes blazed with mingled fright and\\nfury. She noticed that she was being carried not into the wood, but\\nalong it, and was not surprised when they emerged on to the road where\\nit had rounded the bend.\\n\\nWith a sick feeling of terror, she saw a coach standing in the road, and\\nguessed, even before she knew, what was her fate. Through a haze she saw\\na man standing at the door, and then she was thrust into the coach and\\nmade to sit down on the softly-cushioned seat. All her energies were\\nconcentrated in fighting against the faintness that threatened to\\novercome her. She won gradually, and strained her ears to catch what was\\nbeing said outside.\\n\\nShe caught one sentence in a familiar, purring voice:\\n\\n\"Set them loose and tie this to the pummel.\" Then there was silence.\\n\\nPresently she heard footsteps returning. An indistinguishable murmur\\nfrom Harper, and the door opened to allow his Grace of Andover to enter\\nthe coach. It gave a lurch and rumbled on.\\n\\nTracy looked down with a slight smile into the gold-flecked eyes that\\nblazed so indignantly into his.\\n\\n\"A thousand apologies, Miss Beauleigh! Allow me to remove this scarf.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he untied the knot, and the silk fell away from her face.\\n\\nFor a moment she was silent, struggling for words wherewith to give vent\\nto her fury; then the red lips parted and the small, white teeth showed,\\nclenched tightly together.\\n\\n\"You cur!\" she flung at him in a panting undertone. \"Oh, you cur!--you\\ncoward! Undo my hands!\"\\n\\n\"With pleasure.\" He bowed and busied himself with this tighter knot.\\n\\n\"Pray, accept my heartfelt apologies for incommoding you so grievously.\\nI am sure that you will admit the necessity.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that there were a _man_ here to avenge me!\" she raged.\\n\\nHis Grace tugged at the stubborn knot.\\n\\n\"There are three outside,\" he answered blandly. \"But I do not think they\\nare like to oblige you.\"\\n\\nHe removed her bonds and sat back in the corner, enjoying her. His eyes\\nfell on her bruised wrists, and at once his expression changed, and he\\nfrowned, leaning forward.\\n\\n\"Believe me, I did not mean that,\" he said, and touched her hands.\\n\\nShe flung him off.\\n\\n\"Do not touch me!\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, my dear.\" He leaned back again nonchalantly.\\n\\n\"Where are you taking me?\" she demanded, trying to conceal the fear in\\nher voice.\\n\\n\"Home,\" replied his Grace.\\n\\n\"Home!\" Incredulously she turned to look at him, hope in her eyes.\\n\\n\"Home,\" he reiterated. \"_Our_ home.\"\\n\\nThe hope died out.\\n\\n\"You are ridiculous, sir.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis an art, my dear, most difficult to acquire.\"\\n\\n\"Sir--Mr. Everard--whoever you are--if you have any spark of manliness\\nin you, of chivalry, if you care for me at all, you will this instant\\nset me down!\"\\n\\nNever had she seemed more beautiful, more desirable. Her eyes shone with\\nunshed tears, soft and luminous, and the tragic mouth pleaded, even\\ntrying to smile.\\n\\n\"It would appear that none of these attributes belongs to me,\" murmured\\nhis Grace, and wondered if she would weep. He had never a taste for a\\nweeping woman.\\n\\nBut Diana was proud. She realised that tears, prayers and all would\\navail her nothing, and she was determined not to break down, at least in\\nhis presence. Tracy was surprised to see her arrange her skirts and\\nsettle back against the cushions in the most unconcerned manner\\npossible.\\n\\n\"Then, since you are so ungallant, sir, pray tell me what you purpose\\ndoing with me?\" The tone was light, even bantering, but with his\\nmarvellous, almost uncanny perspicacity, he sensed the breathless terror\\nbehind it.\\n\\n\"Why, my dear, I had planned to marry you,\" he answered, bowing.\\n\\nThe knuckles gleamed white on her clenched hand. \"And if I refuse?\"\\n\\n\"I do not _think_ you will refuse, my dear.\" She could not repress a\\nshiver.\\n\\n\"I do refuse!\" she cried sharply.\\n\\nThe smile with which he received this statement drove the blood cold in\\nher veins.\\n\\n\"Wait. I think you will be glad to marry me--in the end,\" he drawled.\\n\\nHer great eyes were hunted, desperate, and her face was very white. The\\ndry lips parted.\\n\\n\"I think--you will be--very sorry--when my father--comes.\"\\n\\nThe indulgent sneer brought the blood racing back to her cheeks.\\n\\n\"And he will come!\"\\n\\nHis Grace was politely interested.\\n\\n\"Really? But I do not doubt it, Diana, an he knows where to come.\"\\n\\n\"He will find a way, never fear!\"\\n\\nShe laughed with a confidence she was far from feeling.\\n\\n\"I do not fear--not in the least--I shall be delighted to welcome him,\"\\npromised his Grace. \"I do not anticipate a refusal of your hand from\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"No?\" Diana, too, could sneer.\\n\\n\"No, my dear. Not after a little--persuasion.\"\\n\\n\"Who are you?\" she shot at him.\\n\\nHis shoulders shook in the soundless laugh peculiar to him.\\n\\n\"I am several people, child.\"\\n\\n\"So I apprehend,\" she retorted smoothly. \"Sir Hugh Grandison amongst\\nthem?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you have guessed that?\"\\n\\n\"It rather leaps to the eye, sir.\" She spoke in what was almost an exact\\nimitation of his sarcastic tone.\\n\\n\"True. It was neatly done, I flatter myself.\"\\n\\n\"Quite marvellous, indeed.\"\\n\\nHe was enjoying her as he had rarely enjoyed a woman before. Others had\\nsobbed and implored, railed and raved; he had never till now met one who\\nreturned him word for word, using his own weapons against him.\\n\\n\"Who else have you the honour to be?\" she asked, stifling a yawn.\\n\\n\"I am Mr. Everard, child, and Duke of Andover.\"\\n\\nThen she turned her head and looked at him with glittering eyes.\\n\\n\"I have heard of you, sir,\" she said, evenly.\\n\\n\"You are like to hear more, my dear.\"\\n\\n\"That is as may be, your Grace.\"\\n\\nNow she understood the elaborate hilt of the mysterious sword with the\\ncoronet on it, wrought in jewels. She wondered whether Jack had it\\nstill, wherever he was. If only some wonderful providence would bring\\nhim to her now in her dire need! There was no one to strike a blow for\\nher; she was entirely at the mercy of a ruthless libertine, whose\\nreputation she knew well, and whose presence filled her with dread and a\\nspeechless loathing. She felt very doubtful that her father would\\nsucceed in finding her. If only Jack were in England! He would come to\\nher, she knew.\\n\\nHis Grace leaned towards her, laying a thin, white hand on her knee.\\n\\n\"My dear, be reasonable. I am not such a bad bargain after all.\"\\n\\nThe tenderness in his voice filled her with horror. He felt her shrink\\naway.\\n\\n\"Take your hand away!\" she commanded throbbingly. \"Do not touch me!\" He\\nlaughed softly and at the sound of it she controlled her terrors and\\ndropped again to the mocking tone she had adopted. \"What? Ungallant\\nstill, your Grace? Pray keep your distance!\"\\n\\nThe pistol holster on the wall at her side caught her attention.\\nInstantly she looked away, hoping he had not observed her. Very little\\nescaped his Grace.\\n\\n\"I am desolated to have to disappoint you, my dear. It is empty.\"\\n\\nShe laid a careless hand on the holster, verifying his statement.\\n\\n\"This? Oh, I guessed it, your Grace!\"\\n\\nHe admired her spirit more and more. Was there ever such a girl?\\n\\n\"My name is Tracy,\" he remarked.\\n\\nShe considered it with her head tilted to one side.\\n\\n\"I do not like your name, sir,\" she answered.\\n\\n\"\\'There was no thought of pleasing you when I was christened,\\'\" he quoted\\nlazily.\\n\\n\"Hardly, sir,\" she said. \"You might be my father.\"\\n\\nIt was a master stroke, and for an instant his brows drew together. Then\\nhe laughed.\\n\\n\"_Merci du compliment, mademoiselle_! I admire your wit.\"\\n\\n\"I protest I am overwhelmed. May I ask when we are like to arrive at our\\ndestination?\"\\n\\n\"We should reach Andover soon after eight, my dear.\"\\n\\nSo it was some distance he was taking her?\\n\\n\"I suppose you had the wit to provide food for the journey?\" she yawned.\\n\"You will not wish to exhibit me at an inn, I take it?\"\\n\\nHe marvelled at her indomitable courage\\n\\n\"We shall halt at an inn certainly, and my servant will bring you\\nrefreshment. That will be in about an hour.\"\\n\\n\"So long?\" she frowned. \"Then, pray excuse me an I compose myself to\\nsleep a little. I am like to find the journey somewhat tedious, I fear.\"\\n\\nShe shifted farther into the corner, leaned her head back against the\\ncushions and closed her eyes.\\n\\nThus outwitting his Grace. For it is impossible to be passionate with a\\ngirl who feigns sleep when she should be struggling to escape from you.\\nSo Tracy, who, whatever else he might lack, possessed a keen sense of\\nhumour, settled himself in his corner and followed her example. So they\\njogged on....\\n\\nArrived at length at the inn, the coach pulled up slowly. Diana opened\\nher eyes with a great assumption of sleepiness.\\n\\n\"Already?\" she marvelled.\\n\\n\"I trust you have slept well,\" said his Grace suavely.\\n\\n\"Excellently well, I thank you, sir,\" was the unblushing reply.\\n\\n\"I am relieved to hear you say so, my dear. I had thought you unable\\nto--your mouth kept shut so admirably. Doubtless you have schooled your\\njaw not to drop when you sleep sitting up? I wish I might do the same.\"\\n\\nThe triumph in his voice was thinly veiled. She found nothing to say.\\n\\nHe rose.\\n\\n\"With your leave, I will go to procure you some refreshment, child. Do\\nnot think me uncivil if I remind you that a servant stands without\\neither door.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you for the kind thought,\" she smiled, but her heart was sick\\nwithin her.\\n\\nHe disappeared, returning a few moments later with a glass of wine and\\nsome little cakes.\\n\\n\"I deplore the scanty nature of your repast,\" he said. \"But I do not\\nwish to waste time. You shall be more fittingly entertained when we\\nreach Andover.\"\\n\\nDiana drank the wine gratefully, and it seemed to put new life into her.\\nThe food almost choked her, but rather than let him see it, she broke a\\ncake in half and started to eat it, playing to gain time: time in which\\nto allow her father a chance of overtaking them before it was too late.\\nShe affected to dislike the cake, and rather petulantly demanded a \\'maid\\nof honour.\\'\\n\\nTracy\\'s eyes gleamed.\\n\\n\"I fear I cannot oblige you, my dear. When we are married you can go to\\nRichmond, and you shall have maids of honour in plenty.\"\\n\\nHe relieved her of her glass, taking it from hands that trembled\\npitifully.\\n\\nThe rest of the journey was as some terrible nightmare. She felt that\\nshe dared no longer feign sleep. She was terrified at what his Grace\\nmight do, and kept him at arm\\'s length by means of her tongue and all\\nher woman\\'s wit. As a matter of fact, Andover had himself well in hand,\\nand had no intention of letting his passion run away with him. But as\\nthe time went on and the light went, some of Diana\\'s control seemed to\\nslip from her, and she became a little less the self-possessed woman,\\nand a little more the trapped and frightened child. When they at last\\nreached Andover Court, and his Grace assisted her to alight her legs\\nwould barely carry her up the steps to the great iron-clamped door. She\\ntrembled anew as he took her hand.\\n\\nOn the threshold he paused and bowed very low. \"Welcome to your future\\nhome, my queen,\" he murmured, and led her in, past wooden-faced footmen\\nwho stared over her head, to his private room, where a table was set for\\ntwo. He would have taken her in his arms then, but she evaded him and\\nslipped wearily into a chair.\\n\\n\"I protest,\" she managed to say, \"I protest, I am faint through want of\\nfood.\"\\n\\nAndover, looking at her white lips, believed her. He took a seat\\nopposite.\\n\\nTwo footmen came to wait on them, and although her very soul was shamed\\nthat they should see her there, she was thankful for their restraining\\npresence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVI\\n\\nMY LORD RIDES TO FRUSTRATE HIS GRACE\\n\\n\\nMy lord yawned most prodigiously and let fall the _Spectator._ His eyes\\nroved towards the clock, and noted with disgust that the hands pointed\\nto half after five. He sighed and picked up the _Rambler_.\\n\\nHis host and hostess were visiting some miles distant, and were not\\nlikely to be back until late, so my lord had a long dull evening in\\nfront of him, which he relished not at all. Lady O\\'Hara had tried to\\ninduce him to accompany them, promising that he would meet no one he\\nknew, but he had for once been prudent and refused steadfastly. So my\\nlady, after pouting crossly at him and assuring him that he was by far\\nthe most obstinate and disagreeable man that she had ever come across,\\nnot excepting her husband, who, to be sure, had been quite prodigiously\\nannoying all day, relented, told him she understood perfectly, and even\\noffered to kiss him to make up for her monstrous ill-humour. Jack\\naccepted the offer promptly, waved farewell to her from the porch, and\\nreturned to the empty drawing-room to while away the time with two\\nnumbers of the _Spectator_ and his own thoughts till dinner, which was\\nto be later than usual to-day, on account of an attack of vapours which\\nhad seized the cook.\\n\\nHis thoughts were too unpleasant to be dwelt on; everything in his world\\nseemed to have gone awry. So he occupied himself with what seemed to him\\na particularly uninteresting number of the _Spectator_. The sun had\\nalmost disappeared, and very soon it became too dark to read; no candles\\nhaving been brought as yet, my lord, very unromantically, went to sleep\\nin his chair. Whether he would have eventually snored is not known, for\\nnot more than a quarter of an hour afterwards the butler roused him with\\nthe magic words:\\n\\n\"Dinner is served, sir.\"\\n\\nCarstares turned his head lazily.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that you say, James?\"\\n\\n\"Dinner is served, sir,\" repeated the man, and held the door wide for\\nhim to pass out.\\n\\n\"Faith! I\\'m glad to hear it!\"\\n\\nMy lord rose leisurely and pulled his cravat more precisely into\\nposition. Although he was to be alone, he gave his costume a touch here\\nand there, and flicked a speck of dust from one great cuff with his\\nelegant lace handkerchief.\\n\\nHe strolled across the old panelled hall to the dining-room, and sat\\ndown at the table.\\n\\nThe curtains were drawn across the windows, and clusters of candles in\\ngraceful silver holders were arranged on the table, shedding a warm\\nlight on to the white damask and the shining covers. The footmen\\npresented a fish, and my lord permitted a little to be put on his plate.\\nThe butler desired to know if Mr. Carr would drink claret or burgundy,\\nor ale? Mr. Carr would drink claret. A sirloin of beef next made its\\nappearance, and went away considerably smaller. Then before my lord was\\nspread an array of dishes. Partridges flanked one end, a pasty stood\\nnext, a cream, two chickens, a duck, and a ham of noble proportions.\\n\\nMy lord went gently through.\\n\\nThe butler desired to know if Mr. Carr would drink a glass of burgundy?\\nHe exhibited a dusty bottle. My lord considered it through his eyeglass\\nand decided in favour. He sipped reflectively and waved the ham away.\\n\\nSweetmeats appeared before him and a soup, while plump pigeons were\\nuncovered at his elbow.\\n\\nOne was whipped deftly on to his plate, and as he took up his knife and\\nfork to carve it, a great scuffling sounded without, angry voices being\\nraised in expostulation, and, above all, a breathless, insistent appeal\\nfor Mr. Carr or Sir Miles. My lord laid down the knife and fork and came\\nto his feet.\\n\\n\"It appears I am demanded,\" he said, and went to the door. It was opened\\nfor him at once, and he stepped out into the hall to find Mr. Beauleigh\\ntrying to dodge the younger footman, who was refusing to let him pass.\\nAt the sight of Carstares he stepped back respectfully. Mr. Beauleigh,\\nhot, distraught, breathless, fell upon my lord.\\n\\n\"Thank God you are here, sir!\" he cried.\\n\\nCarstares observed him with some surprise. Mr. Beauleigh had been so\\nvery frigid when last they had met.\\n\\n\"I am glad to be at your service, sir,\" he bowed. \"You have commands for\\nme?\"\\n\\n\"We are in terrible trouble,\" almost moaned the other. \"Betty bade me\\ncome to find you, or failing you, Sir Miles, for none other can help\\nus!\"\\n\\nCarstares\\' glance grew sharper.\\n\\n\"Trouble? Not--But I forget my manners--we shall talk more at ease in\\nhere.\" He led Mr. Beauleigh into the morning-room. Beauleigh thrust a\\npaper into his hands.\\n\\n\"Diana went riding this afternoon, and only her horse returned--with\\nthis attached to the pommel! Read it, sir! Read it!\"\\n\\n\"Diana!\" Carstares strode over to the light, and devoured the contents\\nof the single sheet, with eager eyes.\\n\\nThey were not long, and they were very much to the point:\\n\\n\"Mr. Beauleigh may haply recall to mind a certain \\'Mr. Everard,\\' of\\nBath, whose Addresses to Miss Beauleigh were cruelly repulsed. He\\nregrets having now to take the Matter into his Own Hands, and trusts to\\nfurther his Acquaintance with Mr. Beauleigh at some Future Date, when\\nMiss Beauleigh shall, He trusts, have become \\'Mrs. Everard.\\'\"\\n\\nJack crumpled the paper furiously in his hand, grinding out a startling\\noath.\\n\\n\"--insolent cur!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, sir! But what will that avail my daughter? I have come\\nstraight to you, for my sister is convinced you know this Everard, and\\ncan tell me where to seek them!\"\\n\\nCarstares clapped a hand on his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Never fear, Mr. Beauleigh! I pledge you my word she shall be found this\\nvery night!\"\\n\\n\"You know where he has taken her? You do? You are sure?\"\\n\\n\"Back to his earth, I\\'ll lay my life; \\'tis ever his custom.\" He strode\\nto the door, flung it wide and shot clear, crisp directions at the\\nfootman. \"See to it that my mare is saddled in ten minutes and Blue\\nDevil harnessed to your master\\'s curricle! Don\\'t stand staring--go! And\\nsend Salter to me!\"\\n\\nThe footman scuttled away, pausing only to inform my lord that Salter\\nwas not in.\\n\\nCarstares remembered that he had given Jim leave to visit his Mary at\\nFittering, and crushed out another oath. He sprang up the stairs, Mr.\\nBeauleigh following breathlessly.\\n\\nIn his room, struggling with his boots, he put a few questions.\\n\\nMr. Beauleigh related the whole tale, dwelling mournfully on the\\nexcellent references for Harper he had received from Sir Hugh Grandison.\\n\\nJack hauled at his second boot.\\n\\n\"Tracy himself, of course!\" he fumed, adjusting his spurs.\\n\\n\"Pray, Mr. Carr, who is this scoundrel? Is it true that you know him?\"\\n\\n\"Andover,\" answered Jack from the depths of the garde-robe. \"Damn the\\nfellow, where has he put my cloak?\" This to the absent Jim, and not the\\nDuke.\\n\\n\"Andover! Not--surely not the Duke?\" cried Mr. Beauleigh.\\n\\n\"I know of none other. At last!\"\\n\\nHe emerged and tossed a heavy, many-caped coat on to the bed.\\n\\n\"Now, sir, your attention for one moment.\"\\n\\nHe was buckling on his sword as he spoke, and not looking at the other\\nman.\\n\\n\"Tracy will have borne Di--Miss Beauleigh off to Andover Court, seven\\nmiles beyond Wyncham, to the south-west. Your horse, I take it, is not\\nfresh,\" (he knew Mr. Beauleigh\\'s horse). \"I have ordered the curricle\\nfor you. I will ride on at once by short cuts, for there is not a moment\\nto be lost--\"\\n\\n\"The Duke of Andover!\" interrupted Mr. Beauleigh. \"The Duke of Andover!\\nWhy, do you think he purposes to marry my daughter?\"\\n\\nJack gave a short, furious laugh.\\n\\n\"Ay! As he married all the others!\"\\n\\nMr. Beauleigh winced.\\n\\n\"Sir! Pray why should you say so?\"\\n\\n\"I perceive you do not know his Grace. Perchance you have heard of Devil\\nBelmanoir?\"\\n\\nThen the little man paled.\\n\\n\"Good God, Mr. Carr, \\'tis not he?\"\\n\\nCarstares caught up his hat and whip.\\n\\n\"Ay, Mr. Beauleigh, \\'tis indeed he. Now perhaps you appreciate the\\nnecessity for haste?\"\\n\\nMr. Beauleigh\\'s eyes were open at last.\\n\\n\"For God\\'s sake, Mr. Carr, after them!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis what I intend, sir. You will follow as swiftly as possible?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, but do not wait for anything! Can you reach Andover--in\\ntime?\"\\n\\n\"I reach Andover to-night,\" was the grim answer. \"And you, sir? You know\\nthe road?\"\\n\\n\"I will find out. Only go, Mr. Carr! Do not waste time, I implore you!\"\\n\\nJack struggled into his riding coat, clapped his hat on to his head, and\\nwith his Grace of Andover\\'s sword tucked beneath his arm, went down the\\nstairs three and four at a time, and hurried out on to the drive, where\\nthe groom stood waiting with Jenny\\'s bridle over his arm. Carstares cast\\na hasty glance at the girths and sprang up. The mare sidled and\\nfidgeted, fretting to be gone, but was held in with a hand of iron while\\nher master spoke to the groom.\\n\\n\"You must drive Mr. Beauleigh to Andover Court as fast as you can. It is\\na matter of life and death. You know the way?\"\\n\\nThe amazed groom collected his wits with difficulty.\\n\\n\"Roughly, sir.\"\\n\\n\"That will do--Mr. Beauleigh will know. Drive your damnedest, man--Sir\\nMiles won\\'t mind. You understand?\"\\n\\nJack\\'s word was law in the O\\'Hara household.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the man, and touched his hat.\\n\\nOn the word, he saw the beautiful straining mare leap forward, and the\\nnext moment both horse and rider were swallowed in the gloom.\\n\\n\"Well I\\'m--darned,\" exploded the groom, and turned to fetch the\\ncurricle.\\n\\nAcross the stretch of moorland went Jack at a gallop, Jenny speeding\\nunder him like the wind, and seeming to catch something of her master\\'s\\nexcitement. Low over her neck he bent, holding the Duke\\'s sword across\\nhis saddle-bows with one hand and with the other guiding her. So he\\ncovered some three miles. He reined in then, and forced her to a canter,\\nsaving her strength for the long distance ahead of them. She was in\\nsplendid condition, glorying in the unrestrained gallop across the turf,\\nand although she was too well-mannered to pull on the rein, Carstares\\ncould see by the eager twitching of her ears how she longed to be gone\\nover the ground. He spoke soothingly to her and guided her on to the\\nvery lane where Diana had ridden that afternoon. She fell into a long,\\neasy stride that seemed to eat up the ground. Now they were off the\\nlane, riding over a field to join another road, leading west. A hedge\\ncut them off, but the mare gathered her legs beneath her and soared\\nover, alighting as gracefully as a bird, and skimming on again up the\\nroad.\\n\\nHer responsive ears flickered as he praised her, and pulled her up.\\n\\n\"Easy now, Jenny, easy!\"\\n\\nShe was trembling with excitement, but she yielded to his will and\\ntrotted quietly for perhaps another half-hour.\\n\\nCarstares rose and fell rhythmically in the saddle, taking care to keep\\nhis spurred heels from her glossy sides. He guessed the time to be about\\nseven o\\'clock, and his brows drew together worriedly. Jenny was made of\\nsteel and lightning, but would she manage it? He had never tested her\\npowers as he was about to now, and he dared not allow her much breathing\\nspace. Every minute was precious if he were to reach Andover before it\\nwas too late.\\n\\nAssuming that Tracy had captured Diana at four, or thereabouts, he\\nreckoned that it should take a heavy coach four hours or more to reach\\nAndover. Jenny might manage it in two and a half hours, allowing for\\nshort cuts, in which case he ought to arrive not long after the others.\\n\\nHe was tortured by the thought of Diana at the mercy of a man of Tracy\\'s\\ncalibre; Diana in terror; Diana despairing. Unconsciously he pressed his\\nknees against the smooth flank and once more Jenny fell into that long,\\nswift stride. She seemed to glide over the ground with never a jar nor a\\nstumble. Carstares was careful not to irk her in any way, only keeping a\\nguiding, restraining hand on the rein, and for the rest letting her go\\nas she willed. On and on they sped, as the time lagged by, sometimes\\nthrough leafy lanes, at others over fields and rough tracks. Not for\\nnothing had Carstares roamed this country for two years; almost every\\npath was familiar to him; he never took a wrong turn, never swerved,\\nnever hesitated. On and on, past sleeping villages and lonely\\nhomesteads, skirting woods, riding up hill and down dale, never\\nslackening his hold on the rein, never taking his eyes off the road\\nbefore him, except now and then to throw a glance to the side on the\\nlook-out for some hidden by-path. After the first hour a dull pain in\\nhis shoulder reminded him of his wound, still troublesome. He set his\\nteeth and pressed on still faster.\\n\\nThe mare caught her foot on a loose stone and stumbled. His hand held\\nher together, the muscles standing out like ribbed steel, his voice\\nencouraged her, and he made her walk again. This time she did not fret\\nagainst the restraint. He shifted the sword under his bridle hand, and\\npassed the right down her steaming neck, crooning to her softly beneath\\nhis breath.\\n\\nShe answered with a low, throbbing whinny. She could not understand why\\nhe desired her to gallop on, braving unknown terrors in the dark; all\\nshe could know was that it was his wish. It seemed also that he was\\npleased with her. She would have cantered on again, but he made her walk\\nfor, perhaps, another five minutes, until they were come to a stretch of\\ncommon he knew well. It was getting late, and he pressed her with his\\nknee, adjuring her to do her best, and urging her to a gallop, leaning\\nright forward, the better to pierce the darkness ahead. A gorse bush\\nloomed before them, and Jenny shied at it, redoubling her pace.\\n\\nWith hand and voice he soothed her, and on they sped. He judged the time\\nto be now about half-past eight, and knew that they must make the\\nremaining miles in an hour. Even now the coach might have arrived, and\\nbeyond that he dared not think.\\n\\nAnother half-hour crept by, and he could feel the mare\\'s breath coming\\nshort and fast, and reined in again, this time to a canter. He was off\\nthe moor now, on a road he remembered well, and knew himself to be not\\nten miles from Wyncham. Five more miles as the crow flies.... He knew\\nhe must give Jenny another rest, and pulled up, dismounting and going to\\nher head.\\n\\nHer legs were trembling, and the sweat rolled off her satin skin. She\\ndropped her nose into his hand, sobbingly. He rubbed her ears and patted\\nher, and she lipped his cheek lovingly, breathing more easily.\\n\\nUp again then, and forward once more, skimming over the ground.\\n\\nLeaving Wyncham on his right, Carstares cut west and then north-west, on\\nthe highroad now, leading to Andover. Only two more miles to go....\\n\\nJenny stumbled again and broke into a walk. Her master tapped her\\nshoulder, and she picked up her stride again.\\n\\nShe was almost winded, and he knew it, but he had to force her onwards.\\nShe responded gallantly to his hand, although her breath came sobbingly\\nand her great, soft eyes were blurred.\\n\\nAt last the great iron gates were in view; he could see them through the\\ndusk, firmly shut. He pulled up and walked on, looking for a place in\\nthe hedge where Jenny might push through.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVII\\n\\nMY LORD ENTERS BY THE WINDOW\\n\\n\\nHis Grace of Andover made a sign to the footmen, and with a sinking\\nheart Diana watched them leave the room, discreetly closing the door\\nbehind them. She affected to eat a peach, skinning it with fingers that\\nwere stiff and wooden. Tracy leaned back in his chair, surveying her\\nthrough half-shut eyelids. He watched her eat her peach and rise to her\\nfeet standing with her hand on the back of the high, carved chair. She\\naddressed him nervously and with would-be lightness.\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I have eaten, and I protest I am fatigued. Pray have the\\ngoodness to conduct me to your housekeeper.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" he drawled, \"nothing would give me greater pleasure--always\\nsupposing that I possessed one.\"\\n\\nShe raised her eyebrows haughtily.\\n\\n\"I presume you have at least a maidservant,\" she inquired. \"If I am to\\nremain here, I would retire.\"\\n\\n\"You shall, child, all in good time. But do not be in a hurry to deprive\\nme of your fair company.\" He rose as he spoke, and taking her hand, led\\nher dumbly to a low-backed settee at the other end of the great room.\\n\\n\"If you have aught to say to me, your Grace, I beg that you will reserve\\nit until to-morrow. I am not in the humour to-night.\"\\n\\nHe laughed at her.\\n\\n\"Still so cold, child?\"\\n\\n\"I am not like to be different, sir.\"\\n\\nHis eyes glinted.\\n\\n\"You think so? I shall show you that you are wrong, my dear. You may\\nloathe me, you may love me, but I think you will lose something of that\\nicy indifference. Allow me to point out to you that there is a couch\\nbehind you.\"\\n\\n\"I perceive it, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Then be seated.\"\\n\\n\"It is not worth the while, sir. I am not staying.\" He advanced one step\\ntowards her with that in his face that made her sink hurriedly on to the\\ncouch.\\n\\nHe nodded smiling.\\n\\n\"You are wise, Diana.\"\\n\\n\"Why so free with my name, sir?\" This with icy sweetness.\\n\\nTracy flung himself down beside her, his arm over the back of the settee\\nand the fingers of his drooping hand just touching her shoulder. It was\\nall the girl could do to keep from screaming. She felt trapped and\\nhelpless, and her nerve was in pieces.\\n\\n\"Nay, sweet! An end to this quibbling. Bethink you, is it worth your\\nwhile to anger me?\"\\n\\nShe sat rigid and silent.\\n\\n\"I love you--ay, you shudder. One day you will not do that.\"\\n\\n\"You call this love, your Grace?\" she cried out, between scorn and\\nmisery.\\n\\n\"Something near it,\" he answered imperturbably.\\n\\n\"God help you then!\" she shivered, thinking of one other who had loved\\nher so differently.\\n\\n\"Belike He will,\" was the pleasant rejoinder. \"But we wander from the\\npoint. It is this: you shall retire to your chamber at once--er--armed\\nwith the key--an you will swear to marry me to-morrow.\"\\n\\nVery white, she made as if to rise. The thin fingers closed over her\\nshoulders, forcing her to remain.\\n\\n\"No, my dear. Sit still.\"\\n\\nHer self-control was slipping away from her; she struggled to be free of\\nthat hateful hand.\\n\\n\"Oh, you brute, you brute! Let me go!\"\\n\\n\"When you have given me your answer, sweetheart.\"\\n\\n\"It is no!\" she cried. \"A thousand times no!\"\\n\\n\"Think....\"\\n\\n\"I have thought! I would rather die than wed you!\"\\n\\n\"Very possibly. But death will not be your lot, my pretty one,\" purred\\nthe sinister voice in her ear. \"Think carefully before you answer; were\\nit not better to marry me with all honour than to--\"\\n\\n\"You devil!\" she panted, and looked wildly round for some means of\\nescape. The long window was open, she knew, for the curtain blew out\\ninto the room. But his Grace was between it and her.\\n\\n\"You begin to think better of it, child? Remember, to-morrow will be too\\nlate. This is your chance, now. In truth,\" he took a pinch of snuff, \"in\\ntruth, it matters not to me whether you will be a bride or no.\"\\n\\nWith a sudden movement she wrenched herself free and darted to the\\nwindow. In a flash he was up and had caught her as she reached it,\\nswinging her round to face him.\\n\\n\"Not so fast, my dear. You do not escape me so.\"\\n\\nHis arm was about her waist, drawing her irresistibly towards him. Sick\\nwith fear, she struck madly at the face bent close to hers.\\n\\n\"Let me go! How dare you insult me so? Oh, for God\\'s sake let me go!\"\\n\\nHe was pressing her against him, one hand holding her wrists behind her\\nin a grip of iron, his other arm about her shoulders.\\n\\n\"For my own sake I will keep you,\" he smiled, and looked gloatingly down\\nat her beautiful, agonised countenance, with its wonderful eyes gazing\\nimploringly at him, and the sensitive mouth a-quiver. For one instant he\\nheld her so, and then swiftly bent his head and pressed his lips to\\nhers.\\n\\nShe could neither struggle nor cry out. A deadly faintness assailed her,\\nand she could scarcely breathe.\\n\\n\"By God, it is too late!\" he swore. \"You had best give in, madam--nought\\ncan avail you now.\"\\n\\nAnd then the unexpected happened. Even as in her last desperate effort\\nto free herself she moaned the name of him whom she deemed hundreds of\\nmiles away across the sea, a crisp voice, vibrating with a species of\\ncold fury, sounded directly behind them.\\n\\n\"You delude yourself, Belmanoir,\" it said with deadly quiet.\\n\\nWith an oath Tracy released the girl and wheeled to face the intruder.\\n\\nFramed by the dark curtains, drawn sword in hand, murder in his blue\\neyes, stood my lord.\\n\\nTracy\\'s snarl died slowly away as he stared, and a look of blank\\namazement took its place.\\n\\nDiana, almost unable to believe her eyes, dizzy with the suddenness of\\nit all, stumbled blindly towards him, crying:\\n\\n\"Thank God! Thank God! Oh, Jack!\"\\n\\nHe caught her in his arms, drawing her gently to the couch.\\n\\n\"Dear heart, you never doubted I should come?\"\\n\\n\"I thought you in France!\" she sobbed, and sank down amongst the\\ncushions.\\n\\nCarstares turned to meet his Grace.\\n\\nTracy had recovered from the first shock of surprise and was eyeing him\\nthough his quizzing glass.\\n\\n\"This is an unexpected pleasure, my lord,\" he drawled with easy\\ninsolence.\\n\\nDiana started at the mode of address and looked up at Carstares,\\nbewildered.\\n\\n\"I perceive your sword in the corner behind you, your Grace!\" snapped\\nJack, and flung over to the door, twisting the key round in the lock and\\nslipping it into his breeches pocket.\\n\\nTo Diana he was as a stranger, with no laugh in the glittering blue\\neyes, and none of the almost finicking politeness that usually\\ncharacterised his bearing. He was very white, with lips set in a hard\\nstraight line, and his nostrils slightly expanded.\\n\\nHis Grace shrugged a careless refusal.\\n\\n\"My dear Carstares, why should I fight you?\" he inquired, seemingly not\\nin the least annoyed by the other\\'s intrusion.\\n\\n\"I had anticipated that answer, your Grace. So I brought _this_!\"\\n\\nAs he spoke Jack drove the sword he held into the wood floor, where it\\nstayed, quivering.\\n\\nNonchalantly Tracy took it in his hand and glanced at the hilt.\\n\\nHis fingers tightened on it convulsively, and he shot a piercing glance\\nat Jack.\\n\\n\"I am entirely at your service,\" he said very smoothly, and laid the\\nsword on the table.\\n\\nSome of the glare died out of my lord\\'s eyes, and a little triumphant\\nsmile curved the corners of his mouth. Quickly he divested himself of\\nhis fine velvet coat, his waistcoat and his scabbard, and pulled off\\nthe heavy riding boots, caked with mud. He proceeded to tuck up his\\nruffles, awaiting his Grace\\'s convenience.\\n\\nAs one in a dream, Diana saw the table pushed back, the paces measured,\\nand heard the ring of steel against steel.\\n\\nMy lord opened the attack after a few moments\\' cautious circling,\\nlunging swiftly and recovering, even as the Duke countered and delivered\\na lightning _riposte en quinte_. My lord parried gracefully in tierce,\\nand chuckled softly to himself.\\n\\nWith parted lips and wide eyes, the girl on the couch watched each fresh\\nlunge. A dozen times it seemed as though Carstares must be run through,\\nbut each time, by some miraculous means, he regained his opposition, and\\nthe Duke\\'s blade met steel.\\n\\nOnce, indeed, thrusting in _quarte_, Tracy\\'s point, aimed too high,\\nflashed above the other\\'s guard and ripped the cambric shirt at the\\nsleeve. My lord retired his foot nimbly, parried, and _riposted_ with a\\nstraight thrust, wrist held high, before Tracy could recover his\\nopposition. The blades clashed as forte met foible, and my lord lunged\\nstraight at his opponent\\'s breast.\\n\\nDiana shut her eyes, expecting every moment to hear the dull thud of\\nTracy\\'s body as it should fall to the ground. It did not come, but\\ninstead there sounded a confused stamping, and scraping of blades, and\\nshe looked again to find the Duke disengaging over my lord\\'s supple\\nwrist and being parried with the utmost ease and dexterity.\\n\\nCarstares knew that he would not be able to last long, however. His\\nshoulder, fretted by the long ride, was aching intolerably, and his\\nwrist seemed to have lost some of its cunning. He was conscious of a\\nsinging in his head which he tried, in vain, to ignore. But his eyes\\nglowed and sparkled with the light of battle and the primitive lust to\\nkill.\\n\\nThe Duke was fencing with almost superhuman skill, moving heavily and\\ndeliberately, seemingly tireless.\\n\\nCarstares, on the other hand, was as swift and light as a panther, grace\\nin every turn of his slim body.\\n\\nHe feinted suddenly inside the arm, deceiving the parade of tierce. His\\nGrace fell back a pace, parrying in _quarte_, and as John with a quick\\ntwist changed to _quarte_ also and the blades crossed, Tracy lunged\\nforward the length of his arm, and a deep red splash stained the\\nwhiteness of my lord\\'s sleeve at the shoulder.\\n\\nDiana gave a choked cry, knowing it to be the old wound, and the Duke\\'s\\nblade came to rest upon the ground.\\n\\n\"You are--satisfied?\" he asked coolly, but panting a little.\\n\\nMy lord reeled slightly, controlled himself and brushed his left hand\\nacross his eyes.\\n\\n\"On guard!\" was all he replied, ignoring a pleading murmur from the\\ngirl.\\n\\nTracy shrugged, meeting Carstares\\' blade with his, and the fight went\\non.\\n\\nTracy\\'s eyes were almost shut, it appeared to Diana, his chin thrust\\nforward, his teeth gripping the thin lower lip.\\n\\nTo her horror she saw that Carstares was breathing in gasps, and that\\nhis face was ashen in hue. It was torture to her to sit impotent, but\\nshe held herself in readiness to fly to his rescue should the need\\narise. Suddenly my lord feinted on both sides of the arm and ripped open\\nthe Duke\\'s sleeve, causing a steady trickle of blood to drip down on to\\nthe floor.\\n\\nTracy took no notice, but countered so deftly that John\\'s blade wavered,\\nand he staggered back. For an instant it seemed as though the end had\\ncome, but somehow he steadied himself, recovering his guard.\\n\\nDiana was on her feet now, nearly as white as her lover, her hands\\npressed to her breast. She saw that John\\'s point was no longer so\\npurposeful, and the smile had gone from his lips. They were parted now,\\nthe upper one rigid, and a deep furrow cut into his brow.\\n\\nThen, startling in the stillness of the great house, came the clanging\\nof a bell, pulled with some violence.\\n\\nCarstares\\' white lips moved soundlessly, and Diana, guessing it to be\\nher father, moved, clinging to the wall, towards the door.\\n\\nA moment later along the passage came the sound of steps; a gay,\\nboisterous voice was raised, followed by a deeper, graver one.\\n\\nHis Grace\\'s face became devilish in its expression, but Carstares took\\nno notice, seeming not to hear. Only he thrust with such skill that his\\nGrace was forced to fall back a pace. The loud voices demanded to know\\nwhat was toward in the locked room, and Diana, knowing that my lord was\\nnearly spent, beat upon the panels.\\n\\n\"Quickly, quickly!\" she cried. \"Break through, for heaven\\'s sake,\\nwhoever you are! \\'Tis locked!\"\\n\\n\"Good Gad! \\'tis a woman!\" exclaimed the voice. \"Listen,\\nDick!--why--why--\\'tis a fight!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, be _quick_!\" implored poor Diana.\\n\\nAnd then came the deeper voice: \"Stand away, madam, we will burst the\\nlock.\"\\n\\nShe moved quickly aside, turning her attention once more to the duel by\\nthe window, as Andrew flung his shoulder against the stout wood. At the\\nthird blow the lock gave, the door flew wide, and Lord Andrew was\\nprecipitated into the room.\\n\\nAnd the two by the window fought on unheeding, faster and faster.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m damned!\" said Andrew, surveying them. He walked forward\\ninterestedly, and at the same moment caught sight of Jack\\'s face. He\\nstared in amazement, and called to Richard.\\n\\n\"Good Lord! Here! Dick! Come here! Surely it\\'s--_who_ is that man?\"\\n\\nDiana saw the tall gentleman, so like her lover in appearance, step\\nforward to the young rake\\'s side. The next events happened in a flash.\\nShe heard a great cry, and before she had time to know what he was\\ndoing, Richard had whipped his sword from its scabbard and had struck up\\nthe two blades. In that moment the years rolled back, and, recognising\\nhis brother, Jack gasped furiously:\\n\\n\"Damn--you--Dick! Out--of--the way!\"\\n\\nTracy stood leaning on his sword, watching, his breath coming in gasps,\\nbut still with that cynical smile on his lips.\\n\\nRichard, seeing that his brother would fly at the Duke again, closed\\nwith him, struggling to wrest the rapier from his weakened grasp.\\n\\n\"You fool, John, leave go! Leave go, I say!\"\\n\\nWith a twist he had the sword in his hand and sent it spinning across\\nthe room as without a sound my lord crumpled up and fell with a thud to\\nthe floor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVIII\\n\\nIN WHICH WHAT THREATENED TO BE TRAGEDY TURNS TO COMEDY\\n\\n\\nWith a smothered cry Diana flew across the room to where my lord lay in\\na pitiful little heap, but before her was Richard. He fell on his knees\\nbeside the still figure, feeling for the wound.\\n\\nDiana, on the other side, looked across at him.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis his shoulder, sir--an old wound. Oh, he is not--he cannot\\nbe--_dead_?\"\\n\\nRichard shook his head dumbly and gently laid bare the white shoulder.\\nThe wound was bleeding very slightly, and they bound it deftly betwixt\\nthem, with their united handkerchiefs and a napkin seized from the\\ntable.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis exhaustion, I take it,\" frowned Richard, his hand before the pale\\nlips. \"He is breathing still.\"\\n\\nOver her shoulder Diana shot an order:\\n\\n\"One of you men, please fetch water and cognac!\"\\n\\n\"At once, madam!\" responded Andrew promptly, and hurried out.\\n\\nShe bent once more over my lord, gazing anxiously into his face.\\n\\n\"He will live? You--are sure? He--he must have rid all the way from\\nMaltby--for me!\" She caught her breath on a sob, pressing one lifeless\\nhand to her lips.\\n\\n\"For you, madam?\" Richard looked an inquiry.\\n\\nShe blushed.\\n\\n\"Yes--he--we--I--\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" said Richard gravely.\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n\"Yes, and--and the Duke--caught me, and--brought me here--and--and then\\n_he_ came--and saved me!\"\\n\\nThe air blowing in from the window stirred the ruffles of my lord\\'s\\nshirt, and blew a strand of her dark hair across Diana\\'s face. She\\ncaught it back and stared at Richard with a puzzled air.\\n\\n\"Pardon me, sir--but you are so like him!\"\\n\\n\"I am his brother,\" answered Richard shortly.\\n\\nHer eyes grew round with surprise.\\n\\n\"His _brother_, sir? I never knew Mr. Carr had a brother!\"\\n\\n\"Mr.--who?\" asked Richard.\\n\\n\"Carr. It is not his name, is it? I heard the Duke call him\\nCarstares--and--my lord.\"\\n\\n\"He is the Earl of Wyncham,\" answered Richard, stretching out a hand to\\nrelieve Andrew of the jug of water he was proffering.\\n\\n\"Good--gracious!\" gasped Diana. \"B-but he said he was a highwayman!\"\\n\\n\"Quite true, madam.\"\\n\\n\"True? But how--how ridiculous--and how like him!\"\\n\\nShe soaked a handkerchief in the water, and bathed my lord\\'s forehead.\\n\\n\"He is not coming to in the least,\" she said nervously. \"You are sure\\n\\'tis not--not--\"\\n\\n\"Quite. He\\'ll come round presently. You said he had ridden far?\"\\n\\n\"He must have, sir--I wish he were not so pale--he was staying with the\\nO\\'Haras at Maltby.\"\\n\\n\"What? The O\\'Haras?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--and he must have ridden from there--and his wound still so\\ntender!\" Again she kissed the limp hand.\\n\\nOver by the window his Grace, his breath recovered, was eyeing Andrew\\nthrough his quizzing-glass.\\n\\n\"May I inquire what brings you here?\" he asked sweetly. \"And why you saw\\nfit to bring the saintly Richard?\"\\n\\n\"I came because it suited me to do so. I never dreamed you were\\nhere--\\'Pon my soul, I did not!\"\\n\\n\"Where then did you think I was?\"\\n\\n\"Never thought about you at all, my dear fellow. I\\'m not your squire.\"\\n\\n\"Why is Richard here?\"\\n\\n\"Lord, what a catechism! He is here because he brought me with him on\\nhis way to Wyncham. Have you any objection?\"\\n\\n\"It would be useless,\" shrugged Tracy. \"Have I killed that young fool?\"\\n\\nAndrew looked him over in disgust.\\n\\n\"No, you have not. You have barely touched him, thanks be.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me! Why this sudden affection for Carstares?\"\\n\\nAndrew swung round on his heel, remarking over his shoulder:\\n\\n\"He may be a cheat, but he\\'s a damned fine fellow. By Gad! he nearly\\npinked you as I entered!\" He chuckled at the memory of that glorious\\nmoment.\\n\\n\"He nearly pinked me a dozen times,\" replied Tracy, binding his arm\\nround more tightly. \"He fights like ten devils. But he was fatigued.\"\\n\\nHe followed Andrew across the room and stood looking down at his\\nunconscious foe.\\n\\nDiana\\'s eyes challenged him.\\n\\n\"Stand back, your Grace! You have no more to do here!\"\\n\\nHe drew out his snuff-box and took a pinch.\\n\\n\"So that is how the matter lies, my dear. I did not know that.\"\\n\\n\"You pretend that it would have made a difference in your treatment of\\nme?\"\\n\\n\"Not the slightest, child,\" he replied, shutting the box with a snap.\\n\"It has merely come as a slight surprise to me. It seems he has the luck\\nthis round.\" He walked away again as another great bell-peal sounded\\nthrough the house.\\n\\nAndrew, pouring cognac into a glass, paused with bottle held in mid-air.\\n\\n\"Thunder and turf! We are like to be a party! Who now?\" He set the glass\\ndown and lounged out of the room, bottle in hand. They heard him give an\\nastonished cry and a loud laugh, and the next moment O\\'Hara strode into\\nthe room, booted and spurred and enveloped in a heavy surcoat. He came\\nswiftly upon the little group about my lord and went down on one knee\\nbeside him. His eyes seemed to take in everyone at a glance. Then he\\nlooked across at Richard.\\n\\n\"Is he alive?\"\\n\\nRichard nodded, not meeting the hard, anxious gaze.\\n\\nO\\'Hara bent over his friend.\\n\\n\"He has been wounded?\"\\n\\nDiana answered this.\\n\\n\"Only slightly, Sir Miles, but \\'twas his shoulder again. He was tired\\nafter the ride--Mr. Carstares thinks he has fainted from exhaustion.\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara very gently slipped one arm beneath my lord\\'s shoulders and the\\nother under his knees, rising with him as easily as if he were carrying\\na baby. He walked over to the couch, lowering his burden on to the\\ncushions that Diana placed to receive him.\\n\\n\"He will be easier there,\" he said, and looked across at her.\\n\\n\"Ye are quite safe, child?\"\\n\\n\"Quite--quite--He came just in time--and fought for me.\" She dabbed\\nopenly at her eyes. \"I--I love him so, Sir Miles--and now I hear that he\\nis an Earl!\" she sighed.\\n\\n\"Well, child, \\'twill make no difference, I take it. I hope he\\'ll make ye\\nhappy.\"\\n\\nShe smiled through her tears very confidently.\\n\\nO\\'Hara turned and faced Richard, who was standing a little in the rear,\\nwatching his brother\\'s face. He met O\\'Hara\\'s scathing look squarely.\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"Nought,\" answered the Irishman cuttingly, and walked over to where Lord\\nAndrew was arguing hotly with his brother.\\n\\nCarstares returned to my lord\\'s side and stood looking silently down at\\nhim.\\n\\nDiana suddenly gave a little joyful cry.\\n\\n\"He is coming round! He moved his head! Oh, Jack, my dear one, look at\\nme!\" She bent over him with eyes alight with love.\\n\\nMy lord\\'s eyelids flickered and opened. For a moment he stared at her.\\n\\n\"Why--Diana!\" She took his head between her hands and kissed him full on\\nthe mouth. Then she raised his head to look into the blue eyes.\\n\\nMy lord\\'s arm crept round her and held her tight against him. After a\\nmoment she disengaged herself and stood aside. Jack\\'s eyes, still a\\nlittle bewildered, fell upon his brother. He struggled up on his elbow.\\n\\n\"Am I dreaming? _Dick_!\" His voice was full of a great joy. Richard went\\nquickly to him, trying to put him back on the cushions.\\n\\n\"My dear Jack--no, no--lie still!\"\\n\\n\"Lie still?\" cried my lord, swinging his feet to the ground. \"Not a bit\\nof it! I am well enough, but a trifle dizzy. How in thunder did you come\\nhere? Surely \\'twas you knocked up my sword? Yes? Interfering young cub!\\nGive me your arm a minute!\"\\n\\n\"But why do you want to get up?\" pleaded a soft voice in his ear.\\n\\n\"So that I can take you in my arms, sweetheart,\" he answered, and\\nproceeded to do so.\\n\\nThen his glance, wandering round the room, alighted on the heated group\\nby the table; Andrew vociferously indignant, Tracy coolly sarcastic, and\\nO\\'Hara furious.\\n\\n\"Tare an\\' ouns!\" ejaculated my lord. \"Where _did_ they all spring from?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t quite know!\" laughed Diana. \"Sir Miles came a few minutes\\nago--the other gentleman came with Mr. Carstares.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, I remember him--\\'tis Andrew, eh, Dick? Zounds! how he has grown!\\nBut what in the world are they all fighting over? Miles! Miles, I say!\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara wheeled round, surprised.\\n\\n\"Oho! Ye are up, are ye.\" He crossed to his side. \"Then sit down!\"\\n\\n\"Since you are all so insistent, I will. How did you come here?\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara went round to the back of the couch to arrange a cushion beneath\\nthe hurt shoulder, and leaned his arms upon the back, looking down with\\na laugh in his eyes.\\n\\n\"Faith, I rode!\"\\n\\n\"But how did you know? Where--\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twas all on account of that young rascal David,\" he said. \"Molly\\nfretted and fumed all the way to the Frasers, vowing the child would be\\nneglected, and what not, and we\\'d not been in the house above an hour or\\nso, when up she jumps and says she knows that _something_ has happened\\nat home, and nothing will suffice but that I must drive her back. We\\narrived just as Beauleigh was setting out. He told us the whole tale,\\nand of course I had Blue Peter saddled in the twinkling of an eye and\\nwas off after ye. But, what with taking wrong turns and me horse not\\nhappening to be made of lightning, I couldn\\'t arrive until now.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot have been so long after me,\" said Jack. \"For I wasted full\\nhalf-an-hour outside here, trying to find an opening in the hedge for\\nJenny to get through. She is now stalled in a shed at the bottom of the\\nlawn with my cloak over her. I\\'ll swear she\\'s thirsty, too.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll see to that,\" promised O\\'Hara.\\n\\nAndrew came across the room and bowed awkwardly to my lord, stammering a\\nlittle. Carstares held out his hand. \"Lord, Andy! I scarce knew you!\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s hesitation, Andrew took the outstretched hand and\\nanswered, laughingly. But my lord had not failed to notice the\\nhesitation, short though it had been.\\n\\n\"I--beg your pardon. I had forgot,\" he said stiffly.\\n\\nAndrew sat down beside him, rather red about the ears.\\n\\n\"Oh, stuff, Jack! I\\'m a clumsy fool, but I did not mean that!\" Richard\\nstepped forward into the full light of the candles.\\n\\n\"If you will all listen to me one moment, I shall be greatly obliged,\"\\nhe said steadily.\\n\\nLord John started forward.\\n\\n\"Dick!\" he cried, warningly, and would have gone to him, but for\\nO\\'Hara\\'s hand on his shoulder, dragging him back.\\n\\n\"Ah, now, be aisy,\" growled Miles. \"Let the man say it!\"\\n\\n\"Hold your tongue, O\\'Hara! Dick, wait one moment! I want to speak to\\nyou!\"\\n\\nRichard never glanced at him.\\n\\n\"I am about to tell you something that should have been told--seven\\nyears ago--\"\\n\\n\"Once and for all, I forbid it!\" snapped my lord, trying to disengage\\nhimself from O\\'Hara\\'s grip.\\n\\nMiles leant over him.\\n\\n\"See here, me boy, if ye don\\'t keep a still tongue in your head, it\\'s\\nmeself that\\'ll be gagging you, and that\\'s that!\"\\n\\nMy lord swore at him.\\n\\nDiana laid a gentle hand on his arm.\\n\\n\"Please, John! Please be still! Why should not Mr. Carstares speak?\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know what he would do!\" fumed Jack.\\n\\n\"In fact, Miss Beauleigh, Sir Miles and Andrew are completely in the\\ndark,\" drawled the Duke. \"Shall I tell the tale, Richard?\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, I shall not require your assistance,\" was the cold\\nrejoinder. \"But I must ask you to be quiet, John.\"\\n\\n\"I will not! You must n--\"\\n\\n\"That will do,\" decided O\\'Hara, and placed a relentless hand over his\\nmouth. \"Go on, Carstares!\"\\n\\n\"For the sake of Miss Beauleigh, I will tell you that seven years ago my\\nbrother and I went to a card-party. I cheated. He took the blame. He has\\nborne it ever since because I was too much a coward to confess. That is\\nall I have to say.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twas for that ye wanted to see me on Friday?\" shot out O\\'Hara.\\n\\nRichard nodded, dully.\\n\\n\"Yes, I was going to tell you then.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m! I\\'m glad ye had decided to play the man\\'s part for once!\"\\n\\nWith a furious oath Jack wrenched himself free and rounded on his\\nfriend.\\n\\n\"You take too much upon yourself, O\\'Hara!\"\\n\\nHe rose unsteadily and walked to Richard\\'s side.\\n\\n\"Dick has told you much, but not all. You none of you know the reasons\\nwe had for acting as we did. But you know him well enough to believe\\nthat it needed very strong reasons to induce him to allow me take the\\nblame. If anyone has aught to say in the matter, I shall be glad if he\\nwill say it to me--now!\" His eyes flashed menacingly as they swept the\\ncompany, and rested for an instant on O\\'Hara\\'s unyielding countenance.\\nThen he turned and held out his hand to his brother with his own\\npeculiarly wistful smile.\\n\\n\"Can you bear to speak to me?\" muttered Richard, with face averted.\\n\\n\"Gad, Dick, don\\'t be ridiculous!\" He grasped the unwilling hand. \"You\\nwould have done the same for me!\"\\n\\nAndrew pressed forward.\\n\\n\"Well, I can see no use in raking up old scores! After all, what does it\\nmatter? It\\'s buried and finished. Here\\'s my hand on it, Dick! Lord! I\\ncouldn\\'t turn my back on the man I\\'ve lived on for years!\" He laughed\\nirrepressibly, and wrung Richard\\'s hand.\\n\\nMy lord\\'s eyes were on O\\'Hara, pleading. Reluctantly the Irishman came\\nforward.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis only fair to tell you, Richard, that I can\\'t see eye to eye with\\nAndrew, here. However, I\\'m not denying that I think a good deal better\\nof ye now than I did--seven years ago.\"\\n\\nRichard looked up eagerly.\\n\\n\"You never believed him guilty?\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara laughed.\\n\\n\"Hardly!\"\\n\\n\"You knew \\'twas I?\"\\n\\n\"I had me suspicions, of course.\"\\n\\n\"I wish--oh, how I wish you had voiced them!\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara raised his eyebrows, and there fell a little silence. His Grace\\nof Andover broke it, coming forward in his inimitable way. He looked\\nround the room at each member of the company.\\n\\n\"One, two, three--four, five--\" he counted. \"Andrew, tell them to lay\\ncovers for five in the dining-room.\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you staying?\" asked his brother, surprised.\\n\\n\"I have supped,\" replied Tracy coolly.\\n\\nFor a moment O\\'Hara\\'s mouth twitched, and then he burst out laughing.\\nEveryone looked at him inquiringly.\\n\\n\"Ecod!\" he gasped. \"Oh, sink me an I ever came across a more amusing\\nvillain! \\'Lay covers for five!\\' Oh, damme!\"\\n\\n\"Or should I have said six?\" continued his Grace imperturbably. \"Am I\\nnot to have the honour of Mr. Beauleigh\\'s company?\"\\n\\nO\\'Hara checked his mirth.\\n\\n\"No, ye are not! He was content to let me manage the business, and went\\nback to Littledean.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry,\" bowed his Grace, and turned to my lord, who, with his arm\\nabout Diana\\'s waist, was watching him arrogantly.\\n\\n\"I see how the land lies,\" he remarked. \"I congratulate you, John. I\\ncannot help wishing that I had finished you that day in the road. Permit\\nme to say that you fence rather creditably.\"\\n\\nMy lord bowed stiffly.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" continued his Grace smoothly, \"you also wish you had\\ndisposed of me. I sympathise. But, however much you may inwardly despise\\nand loathe me, you cannot show it--unless you choose to make yourself\\nand me the talk of town--not forgetting Mistress Diana. Also I abhor bad\\ntragedy. So I trust you will remain here to-night as my guest--er,\\nAndrew, pray do not omit to order bed-chambers to be\\nprepared--Afterwards you need never come near me again--in fact, I hope\\nthat you will not.\"\\n\\nMy lord could not entirely repress a smile.\\n\\n\"I thank your Grace for your hospitality, which I fear,\" he glanced down\\nat Diana\\'s tired face, \"I shall be compelled to accept. As to the\\nrest--I agree. Like you, I dislike bad tragedy.\"\\n\\nDiana gave a tiny laugh.\\n\\n\"You are all so stiff!\" she said _I_ shall go to bed!\"\\n\\n\"I will take you to the stairs then,\" said Jack promptly, and led her\\nforward.\\n\\nShe stopped as they were about to pass his Grace, and faced him.\\n\\nTracy bowed very low.\\n\\n\"Good-night, madam. Carstares will know which room I had assigned to\\nyou. You will find a servant there.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" she said steadily. \"I shall try to forget the happenings of\\nthis day, your Grace. I see the truth in what you say--we cannot afford\\nto let the world see that we are at enmity, lest it should talk. And, I\\nconfess it freely, I find it less hard to forgive you the insults of--of\\nto-day, since they brought--Jack--to me. An I had not been in such dire\\nstraits, I might never have seen him again.\"\\n\\n\"In fact,\" bowed his Grace, \"everything has been for the best!\"\\n\\n\"I would not say that, sir,\" she replied, and went out.\\n\\nFor a moment there was silence in the room. No one quite knew what to\\nsay. As usual, it was Tracy who came to the rescue, breaking an\\nuncomfortable pause.\\n\\n\"I suggest that we adjourn to the dining-room,\" he said. \"I gather we\\nmay have to wait some time before his lordship reappears. O\\'Hara, after\\nyou!\"\\n\\n\"One moment,\" replied Miles. \"Jack\\'s mare is in a shed somewhere. I said\\nI would see to her.\"\\n\\n\"Andrew!\" called his Grace. \"When you have finished superintending the\\nlaying of the supper, give orders concerning Carstares\\' mare!\"\\n\\nA casual assent came from outside, and immediately afterwards Lord\\nAndrew\\'s voice was heard shouting instructions to someone, evidently\\nsome way off.\\n\\nOn the whole, the supper-party passed off quite smoothly. His Grace was\\nsmilingly urbane, Andrew boisterous and amusing, and O\\'Hara bent on\\nkeeping the conversation up. Richard sat rather silent, but my lord,\\nalready deliriously happy, soon let fall his armour and joined in the\\ntalk, anxious to hear all the news of town for the last six years.\\n\\nO\\'Hara was several times hard put to it to keep from laughing out loud\\nat his thoughts. The humour of the situation struck him forcibly. After\\nfighting as grimly as these men fought, and after all that had\\ntranspired, that they should both sit down to supper as they were doing,\\nappealed to him strongly. He had quite thought that my lord would\\nincline to tragedy and refuse to stay an instant longer in the Duke\\'s\\nhouse.\\n\\nIt was not until midnight, when everyone else had gone to bed, that the\\nbrothers came face to face, alone. The dining-room was very quiet now,\\nand the table bore a dissipated look with the remains of supper left on\\nit. My lord stood absently playing with the long-handled punch spoon,\\nidly stirring the golden dregs at the bottom of the bowl. The candles\\nshed their light full on his face, and Richard, standing opposite in the\\nshadow, had ample opportunity of studying it.\\n\\nIt seemed to him that he could not look long enough. Unconsciously his\\neyes devoured every detail of the loved countenance and watched each\\nmovement of the slender hand. He found John subtly changed, but quite\\nhow he could not define. He had not aged much, and he was still the same\\nlaughter-loving Jack of the old days, with just that intangible\\ndifference. O\\'Hara had felt it, too: a slight impenetrability, a\\nreserve.\\n\\nIt was my lord who broke the uncomfortable silence. As if he felt the\\nother\\'s eyes upon him, he looked up with his appealing, whimsical smile.\\n\\n\"Devil take it, Dick, we\\'re as shy as two schoolboys!\"\\n\\nRichard did not smile, and his brother came round the table to his side.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nought to be said betwixt us two, Dick. \\'Twould be so damned\\nunnecessary. After all--we always shared in one another\\'s scrapes!\"\\n\\nHe stood a moment with his hand on Richard\\'s shoulder; then Richard\\nturned to him \"What you must _think_ of me!\" he burst out. \"My God, when\\nI realise--\"\\n\\n\"I know. Believe me, Dick, I know just what you must have felt. But pray\\nforget it! It\\'s over now, and buried.\"\\n\\nThere was another long silence. Lord John withdrew his hand at last, and\\nperched on the edge of the table, smiling across at Richard.\\n\\n\"I\\'d well-nigh forgot that you were a middle-aged papa! A son?\"\\n\\n\"Ay--John--after you.\"\\n\\n\"I protest I am flattered. Lord, to think of you with a boy of your\\nown!\" He laughed, twirling his eyeglass.\\n\\nAt last Richard smiled.\\n\\n\"To think of you an uncle!\" he retorted, and suddenly all vestige of\\nstiffness had fled.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nNext morning Richard went on to Wyncham, and Diana, Jack and O\\'Hara\\ntravelled back to Sussex. Jack would not go home yet. He protested that\\nhe was going to be married first, and would then bring home his\\nCountess. But he had several instructions to give his brother concerning\\nthe preparation of his house. The last thing he requested Richard to do\\nwas to seek out a certain city merchant, Fudby by name, and to rescue a\\nclerk, Chilter, from him, bearing him off to Wyncham. All this he called\\nfrom the coach window, just before they set off.\\n\\nRichard led Jenny, whom he was to ride home, up to the door of the\\nvehicle, and expostulated.\\n\\n\"But what in thunder am I to do with the man?\"\\n\\n\"Give him to Warburton,\" advised Jack flippantly. \"I know he needs a\\nclerk--he always did!\"\\n\\n\"But perhaps he will not desire to come--\"\\n\\n\"You do as I tell you!\" laughed his brother. \"I shall expect to find him\\nat Wyncham when I arrive! _Au revoir_!\" He drew his head in, and the\\ncoach rumbled off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIX\\n\\nLADY O\\'HARA IS TRIUMPHANT\\n\\n\\nAfter spending a restless night, starting at every sound, and hearing\\nthe hours strike slowly away, Lady O\\'Hara arose not a whit refreshed and\\nconsiderably more ill at ease than she had been before.\\n\\nDuring the night she had imagined all sorts of impossible horrors to\\nhave befallen her husband, and if, when the reassuring daylight had\\ncome, the horrors had somewhat dispersed, enough remained to cause her\\nan anxious morning as she alternated between the hall window and the\\ngate.\\n\\nNo less worried was Jim Salter. He had returned from Fittering last\\nnight to find his master and Sir Miles gone, Lady O\\'Hara in a state of\\nfrightened bewilderment, and the house in a whirl. No one, least of all\\npoor Molly, seemed to know exactly where the two men had gone. All she\\nknew was that they had come back upon a scene of turmoil, with Mr.\\nBeauleigh in the midst of a small crowd of excited servants. Her husband\\nhad elbowed his way through, and into his ears had Mr. Beauleigh poured\\nhis story. Then O\\'Hara seemed to catch the excitement, and she had been\\nhurried into the house with the hasty explanation that Jack was off\\nafter Devil, who had caught Diana, and he must to the rescue. Ten\\nminutes after, she had an alarming vision of him galloping off down the\\ndrive, his sword at his side and pistols in the saddle-holsters. The\\npoor little lady had sent an imploring cry after him, checked almost\\nbefore it had left her lips. Afterwards she wished it had never been\\nuttered, and rather hoped that it had escaped O\\'Hara\\'s ears.\\n\\nSalter arrived not half-an-hour later, and his feelings when told that\\nhis beloved master had ridden off in search of a fight, may be more\\neasily imagined than described. He was all for setting out in his wake,\\nbut her ladyship strongly vetoed the plan, declaring that Sir Miles\\nwould be rescue enough, and she was not going to be left entirely\\nwithout protectors. Jim was far too respectful to point out that there\\nwere five able-bodied men, not counting himself, in the house, but as\\nhis master had left no instructions for him, he capitulated.\\n\\nHe proved nought but a Job\\'s comforter next day, for when my lady\\npessimistically premised that both Carstares _and_ her husband were\\nundoubtedly hurt, he did not, as she expected he would, strive to\\nreassure her, but gave a gloomy assent. Whereupon she cast an indignant\\nglance in his direction, and turned her back.\\n\\nAt four in the afternoon they were both in the hall, anxiously watching\\nthe drive.\\n\\n\"To be sure, \\'tis monstrous late!\" remarked Molly, with wide,\\napprehensive eyes.\\n\\n\"Yes, my lady.\"\\n\\n\"If--if nought were amiss, they should have been back by now, surely?\"\\n\\n\"Yes indeed, my lady.\"\\n\\nLady O\\'Hara stamped her foot.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say jes!\" she cried.\\n\\nJim was startled.\\n\\n\"I beg pardon, m\\'lady?\"\\n\\n\"You are not to say yes! After all, they may have gone a long\\nway--they--er--they may be tired! Jenny may have gone\\nlame--anything--anything may have happened!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, m\\'--I mean certainly, your ladyship!\" hastily amended Jim.\\n\\n\"In fact, I should not be surprised an they were not at all hurt!\"\\n\\nHe shook his head despondently, but luckily for him the lady failed to\\nnotice it, and continued with airy cheerfulness:\\n\\n\"For my husband has _often_ told me what an excellent swordsman Mr.\\nCarstares is, and--\"\\n\\n\"Your ladyship forgets his wound.\"\\n\\nWhat she might have been constrained to reply to this is not known, for\\nat that moment came the sound of coach-wheels on the gravel. With one\\naccord she and Salter flew to the door, and between them, wrenched it\\nopen, just as a gentleman\\'s travelling coach, postillioned by men in\\ngold and black, and emblazoned with the Wyncham arms, drew up at the\\ndoor.\\n\\nMy lady was down the steps in the twinkling of an eye, almost before one\\nof the grooms had opened the door to offer an arm to my lord. Carstares\\nsprang lightly out, followed by O\\'Hara, seemingly none the worse for\\nwear.\\n\\nMolly ran straight into her husband\\'s arms, regardless of the servants,\\nhugging him.\\n\\nJim Salter hurried up to my lord.\\n\\n\"Ye are not hurt, sir?\" he cried.\\n\\nCarstares handed him his hat and cloak.\\n\\n\"Nought to speak of, Jim. But \\'Everard\\' well-nigh finished me for all\\nthat!\" He laughed at Jim\\'s face of horror, and turned to Molly, who,\\nhaving satisfied herself that her husband was quite uninjured and had\\nnever once been in danger of his life, had come towards him, full of\\nsolicitude for his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear Jack! Miles tells me you have hurt your poor shoulder\\nagain! And pray what has been done for it? I dare swear not one of you\\ngreat men had the wit to summon a doctor, as indeed you should have,\\nfor--\"\\n\\n\"Whist now, asthore!\" adjured her husband. \"\\'Tis but a clean scratch\\nafter all. Take him into the house and give him something to drink! I\\'ll\\nswear \\'tis what he needs most!\"\\n\\nMolly pouted, laughed and complied.\\n\\nOver the ale Jack related the whole escapade up to the moment when he\\nhad parted from Diana at Littledean. Then O\\'Hara took up the tale with a\\ndelightful chuckle.\\n\\n\"Sure, Molly, ye never saw anything to equal poor old Beauleigh when his\\ndaughter had told him Jack\\'s name! Faith, he didn\\'t know what to do at\\nall, he was so excited! And Miss Betty I thought would have the vapours\\nfrom the way she flew from Di to Jack and back again, in such a state of\\nmind as ye can\\'t imagine!\"\\n\\nMolly, who had listened with round eyes, drew a deep ecstatic breath.\\nThen she bounced up, clapping her hands, and proclaimed that she was\\nright after all!\\n\\n\"What will ye be meaning, alanna?\" inquired O\\'Hara.\\n\\n\"Pray, sir, did I not say _over_ and _over_ again that if I could only\\ninduce Jack to stay with us everything would come right? Now, Miles, you\\nknow I did!\"\\n\\n\"I remember ye said something like it once,\" admitted her spouse.\\n\\n\"Once, indeed! I was always sure of it. And I did coax you to stay, did\\nI not, Jack?\" she appealed.\\n\\n\"You did,\" he agreed. \"You assured me that if I was churlish enough to\\nleave, Miles would slowly sicken and pine away!\"\\n\\nShe ignored her husband\\'s ribald appreciation of this.\\n\\n\"Then you see that \\'tis all owing to me that--\" She broke off to shake\\nO\\'Hara, and the meeting ended in riotous hilarity.\\n\\nWhen he went to change his clothes, Carstares found Jim already in his\\nroom awaiting him. He hailed him gaily, and sat down before his\\ndressing-table.\\n\\n\"I require a very festive costume to-night, Jim. Rose velvet and cream\\nbrocade, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Very good, your lordship,\" was the prim reply.\\n\\nJack slewed round.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"I understand your lordship is an Earl,\" said poor Jim.\\n\\n\"Now who was the tactless idiot who told you that? I had intended to\\nbreak the news myself. I suppose now, you know my--story?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, si--my lord. I--I suppose ye won\\'t be requiring my services any\\nlonger?\"\\n\\n\"In heaven\\'s name, why not? Do you wish to leave me?\"\\n\\n\"Wish to--! No, sir--my lord--I--I thought ye\\'d maybe want a smarter\\nvalet--and--not me.\"\\n\\nMy lord turned back to the mirror and withdrew the pin from his cravat.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be a fool.\"\\n\\nThis cryptic remark seemed greatly to reassure Jim.\\n\\n\"Ye mean it, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I do. I should be lost without you after all this time. Marry\\nthat nice girl at Fittering, and she shall maid my lady. For I\\'m to be\\nmarried as soon as may be!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, s--my lord! I\\'m sure I\\'m very glad, s--your lordship. Rose, sir?\\nWith the silver lacing?\"\\n\\n\"I think so, Jim. And a cream--very pale cream waistcoat, broidered in\\nwith rose. There is one, I know.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir--your lordship.\"\\n\\nMy lord eyed him despondently.\\n\\n\"Er--Jim!\"\\n\\n\"Yes--your lordship?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry, but I cannot endure it.\"\\n\\n\"I beg pardon, my lord?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t have you call me \\'your lordship,\\' after every second word--I\\nreally cannot.\"\\n\\n\"Why, sir--may I still call you \\'sir\\'?\"\\n\\n\"I would much rather you did.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, sir--thank you....\"\\n\\nIn the middle of tying the bow to his master\\'s wig Jim paused, and in\\nthe mirror Jack saw his face fall.\\n\\n\"What\\'s amiss now? And what have you done with my patches?\"\\n\\n\"In that little box, sir--yes--that one. I was just thinking--here\\'s the\\nharesfoot, sir--that I shall never be able to see ye hold up a coach\\nnow!\"\\n\\nMy lord, striving to affix the patch in just the right spot at the\\ncorner of his mouth, tried to control his features, failed, and went off\\ninto a peal of laughter that reached O\\'Hara in the room across the\\nlanding, and caused him to grin delightedly. He had not heard that laugh\\nfor many a long day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEPILOGUE\\n\\n\\nHis Grace of Andover sat at the window of his lodgings at Venice,\\nlooking down at a letter in his hand. The writing was his sister\\'s.\\nAfter a moment he drew a deep breath and broke the seal, spreading the\\nsheets out upon the broad sill.\\n\\n\"My very dear Tracy,\\n\\n\"So you have gone again with no Farewell to yr. poor Sister, sir! I am\\nindeed very offended, but I understand yr. Reason. As soon as I sett\\nmine eyes on Diana I knew the Truth and recognised yr. dark Beauty. I am\\nmonstrous grieved for you, dear. I quite love her myself, altho\\' she is\\nvery tiresomely lovely, but perhaps as she is dark and I am fair, we\\nshall not clash.\\n\\n\"The Home-coming was prodigious exciting. Andrew was present, Dicky, of\\ncourse, and me. Mrs. Fanshawe, too, was there, for she knew Jack Abroad,\\nand a monstrous queer Old Man, who was vastly fidgetty and overcome to\\nsee Jack. Then Sir Miles and his wife came, who I thought quite\\nagreeable nice People, and Diana\\'s Father and Aunt, rather Bourgeois,\\nbut, on the whole, presentable.\\n\\n\"Everyone knows the Truth now, but most People have been prodigious kind\\nand I scarce notice a difference in our Reception. Dearest Dicky is\\ngayer than he was wont to be and more darling, and I almost enjoy being\\na Social Outcast.\\n\\n\"When Diana is properly gowned, as should suit her position (but I\\ngrieve to say that she prefers to dress plainly), she will make a\\nprodigious Elegantt Countess. I have promised to connduct her to my own\\nMantua Maker, which is very sacrificing, as I am sure You will agree. I\\nknow London will go Crazy about her, and, indeed, those who have\\nallready seen her, which is Avon and Falmouth, are positively Foolish. I\\nmake no doubtt \\'twill be very mortifying, but I suppose it must be\\nborne.\\n\\n\"She and Jack are prodigious happy together; it is most Unfashionable,\\nbut so am I happy with Dick, so there are a Pair of us, and we had best\\n_sett_ Fashion.\\n\\n\"Pray, return soon, my dear Tracy, you cannot conceive how I miss you. I\\nwas surprised you went away with Mr. Fortescue, I had no Notion you were\\nso friendly.\\n\\n\"With dearest Love,\\n\\n\"Yr. Sister\\n\\n\"LAVINIA.\\n\\n\"P.S.--\\'Twill interest you to hear that Miss Gunning is to marry\\nCoventry. \\'Tis all over Town this last Week.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSlowly his Grace put the sheets together and handed them to Fortescue,\\nwho had just come into the room.\\n\\n\"These, from my sister, may possibly interest you, Frank.\"\\n\\nFortescue read the letter through, and at the end folded it and handed\\nit back in silence. Tracy laid it down on the table at his elbow.\\n\\n\"I began--wrongly,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" assented his friend. \"She was not--that kind of girl.\"\\n\\n\"But having begun wrongly--I could not undo the wrong.\"\\n\\n\"So you made it worse,\" said Fortescue gently.\\n\\n\"I would have married her in all honour--\"\\n\\n\"In your own arrogant fashion, Tracy.\"\\n\\n\"As you say--in my own arrogant fashion, Frank. If I could go back a\\nyear--but where\\'s the use? I am not whining. Presently I shall return\\nto England and make my bow to--the Countess of Wyncham. Possibly, I\\nshall not feel one jealous qualm. One never knows. At all events--I\\'ll\\nmake that bow.\"\\n\\n\"You will?\" Frank looked sharply down at him. \"Nothing more, Tracy! You\\ndo not purpose--\"\\n\\n\"Nothing more. You see, Frank--I love her.\"\\n\\n\"I crave your pardon. Yes--she would not take you, but she has, I think,\\nmade you. As I once told you, when love came you would count yourself as\\nnought, and her happiness as everything.\"\\n\\nFor a moment his Grace was silent, and then back came the old smile,\\nstill cynical, yet with less of the sneer in it.\\n\\n\"How very pleasant it must be, Frank, to have one\\'s prophecies so\\nhappily verified!\" he purred. \"Allow me to felicitate you!\"\\n\\n\\nTHE END'"
